### Parent Scripts — Age 5 (Piper)

Use clear cues and invite independence. Lightly introduce reading and simple harmony.

General opener:
- "Check posture: tall spine, relaxed shoulders. Find your quiet ready."
- "In 4… breathe low like filling a balloon. Hiss for 6 counts."

Checkpoint A1 (Twinkle):
- "Point to the first note head. Speak the rhythm, then sing."
- "Circle the cadence note where we finish."

Checkpoint A2 (Mary):
- "Clap quarters vs. two eighths. Which bar has ti-ti?"
- "Sing the second line from memory."

Checkpoint A3 (Row):
- "Count 1–2–3–enter. Start together."
- "Try medium vs. soft dynamics on ‘merrily.’"

Checkpoint A4 (Jesus Loves Me):
- "Mark breaths with dots. Keep jaw relaxed for tall vowels."
- "Tell me one word that the song makes you think about."

Checkpoint B3/B4 (Frère Jacques round):
- "I’ll start, you point to bar 2 and enter after one bar."
- "Hold your part even if you hear mine."

Checkpoint E1 (Simple Harmony):
- "Sing a third above me on these notes; I’ll keep melody."
- "Listen for blend, no shouting."

Performance habits:
- "Face the audience, breathe, begin boldly, still finish, friendly bow."
- "If we make a mistake: we keep going with a smile."
