### Curriculum Overview (Classical Approach)

This curriculum is designed for Bella (3) and Piper (5) with one lesson per child per week. Lessons are self-contained and progressive, so you can pause and resume anytime. The approach follows the Classical trivium:

- Grammar (3–6): memorize songs and patterns, form healthy habits (posture, breath, diction), internalize beat and pitch.
- Logic (6–9): connect facts, read notation and rhythms, recognize intervals, sing simple harmony/rounds.
- Rhetoric (9+): communicate meaning, shape phrases, make stylistic choices, perform for an audience.

### Goals by Age Track
- Age 3 (Bella): joyful vocal exploration, simple solfège (do–so), steady beat, clear words, 1–2 short songs by memory.
- Age 5 (Piper): accurate pitch center, 5-note scale patterns (do–so), basic rhythm reading (quarter/half rests), first rounds/harmony with parent, 2–3 songs by memory.

### Session Structure (30–40 minutes)
1) Welcome & posture (2–3 min)
2) Breath + light warmups (5–7 min)
3) Technique focus (5–7 min)
4) Songwork with sheet music (10–15 min)
5) Rhetoric mini-performance or hymn reflection (3–5 min)
6) Assessment & stickers; note next step (2–3 min)

Each weekly plan contains an Age 3 adaptation and an Age 5 extension. If you only have time for 20–25 minutes, do steps 1–4 and mark partial completion.

### Materials
- A4 paper prints of weekly score(s) from `sheet_music/`
- Tuner or piano/keyboard app; metronome app set between 60–84 BPM
- Small props: scarf/ribbon (breath and phrasing), rhythm sticks or claps
- Water bottle

### Safety & Vocal Care
- Warm up gently; stop if there is strain or hoarseness.
- Encourage tall posture and relaxed shoulders; never "push" loud notes.
- Hydrate and schedule vocal rest if tired.

### Integrating Rhetoric (even at young ages)
- Tell the story of the song: “Who is singing? What are they saying?”
- Audience skills: face the listener, start together, finish with stillness and a smile.
- Sunday hymn reflection (optional): sing one hymn verse, discuss a word or image.

### How to Use the Files
- Begin with `Scope_and_Sequence.md` to place the week.
- Open `Weekly_Sessions.md` to run the exact plan.
- Open the listed `.ly` file in `sheet_music/` and print a PDF (see `sheet_music/README.md`).
- Check off the week in `Progress_Tracker.md`.

### Assessment
- Micro-milestones are embedded in each week (pitch match, steady beat, diction, memory, expression).
- Use the tracker to mark "met" or "in progress" and add brief notes.
