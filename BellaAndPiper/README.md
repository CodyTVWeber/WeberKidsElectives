### Bella & Piper: Classical Singing Curriculum (Ages 3 and 5)

This folder contains a comprehensive, pick-up-where-you-left-off curriculum designed for one dedicated session per child per week. It follows a Classical approach (Grammar → Logic → Rhetoric), integrates hymn singing on Sundays if desired, and includes sheet music and ready-to-run parent scripts.

### Quick Start
- Open `Curriculum_Overview.md` to understand the approach and goals.
- Check `Scope_and_Sequence.md` (now a progression map) to see the ordered skill path with expected age ranges.
- Use `Weekly_Sessions.md` (now progression checkpoints) for step-by-step activities you can do in any cadence.
- Open the referenced score in `sheet_music/` for the song/exercise.
- Mark progress in `Progress_Tracker.md` by level and checkpoint.

### One-day-a-week friendly
- Each checkpoint is self-contained. Do one or several when you have time.
- If you pause, resume at the last incomplete checkpoint; no rework needed.

### Classical Approach (at a glance)
- Grammar (Ages ~3–6): Memorize songs/solfège, posture, breath, steady beat, clear diction.
- Logic (Ages ~6–9): Read notes/rhythms, recognize intervals, sing simple harmony/rounds.
- Rhetoric (Ages ~9+): Expressive storytelling, style choices, small recitals.
