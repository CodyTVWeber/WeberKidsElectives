### Exploded diagrams; stapler rebuild

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Read an exploded view; reassemble using diagram logic
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)
- Document observations using engineering notebook best practices
- Develop systematic troubleshooting approaches
- Connect mechanical principles to everyday devices
#### Materials
- Manual stapler (screw‑type), printed exploded view examples (generic), labels
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed
- Digital camera or tablet for documentation
- Storage bins for sorted components
- Reference posters for tool names and safety rules
#### Grammar
- Exploded diagram, assembly order, subassembly
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance
- Assembly, disassembly, component
- Force, motion, energy transfer
- Efficiency, optimization, constraint
#### Procedure
1) Study example exploded diagram; identify subassemblies (10–15 min)
2) Tear down stapler with photos; lay out parts in order (30–40 min)
3) Reassemble; test (10 min); Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)
7) Documentation: Update engineering notebook with findings (5 min)
8) Peer review: Explain your mechanism to a partner (5 min)
9) Clean-up protocol: Sort and store all components properly (5 min)


#### Differentiation
- Support: Pre-sort components by type or size
- Support: Provide step-by-step visual instruction cards
- Support: Work with a peer mentor for complex assemblies
- Challenge: Design modifications to improve the mechanism
- Challenge: Calculate mechanical advantage or gear ratios
- Challenge: Create technical drawings with proper conventions
- Fine motor support: Use larger fasteners or adaptive tools
#### Assessment
- Safety check: Demonstrate proper tool handling before starting
- Process observation: Note systematic approach and organization
- Notebook review: Check for complete documentation and labeled diagrams
- Functionality test: Does the mechanism work as intended?
- Peer review: Partner evaluates build quality and documentation
- Troubleshooting skills: Can student identify and fix common issues?
- Portfolio evidence: Clear photos and written explanations of learning

#### Home Connection
- Take-apart permission: Identify safe household items to explore
- Tool time: Practice skills while helping with home repairs
- Engineering walks: Identify simple machines in the neighborhood
- Family builder challenge: Work together on construction projects
- Share learning: Explain mechanisms found in everyday objects
#### Safety
- Control spring; adult assists
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
