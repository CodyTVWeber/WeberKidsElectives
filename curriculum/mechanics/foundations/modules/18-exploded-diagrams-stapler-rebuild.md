### Exploded diagrams; stapler rebuild

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Read an exploded view; reassemble using diagram logic
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Manual stapler (screw‑type), printed exploded view examples (generic), labels
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Exploded diagram, assembly order, subassembly
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Study example exploded diagram; identify subassemblies (10–15 min)
2) Tear down stapler with photos; lay out parts in order (30–40 min)
3) Reassemble; test (10 min); Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Control spring; adult assists
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
