### Sensors as “feelers”: reed switch buzzer

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Use a magnet and reed switch to control a buzzer/light
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- 3V battery, reed switch, buzzer or LED+resistor, wires, small magnet
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Wire battery → reed switch → buzzer; test with magnet (20–25 min)
2) Discuss sensors in machines (limit switch, float) (5–10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Polarity for LED; avoid short circuits
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
