### Inclined plane & wedge; ramp tests

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Describe how ramps reduce required force over distance
- Compare ramp angles and rolling distance/speed
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Board/books to form ramps; toy car; protractor or angle estimates; soap bar as wedge; tape
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Inclined plane, wedge, angle, friction
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- Why is it easier to push up a long gentle ramp than a short steep one?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Explain your ramp test results to a family member
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Build two ramp angles; predict which is easier (10 min)
2) Test car roll; measure distance/speed (25 min)
3) Explore wedge splitting (soap) vs pushing straight in (10 min)
4) Notebook, photos, Stop Here (15–20 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch ramp; label angle; write 2 findings
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Stabilize ramps; keep fingers clear
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
