### Ratchets & pawls; tape measure teardown

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Observe one‑way motion using ratchet and pawl; controlled teardown of tape measure
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Old tape measure (adult pre‑tapes sharp edges), socket wrench ratchet, gloves, labels
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Ratchet, pawl, recoil spring, one‑way clutch
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- Why does a ratchet allow turning in one direction but not the other?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Show the pawl engaging teeth and describe the effect
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Demonstrate socket ratchet directions (10 min)
2) Carefully open tape measure case; photo; identify recoil spring (30 min)
3) Close and test lock; discuss dangers of spring energy (5 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of pawl; labeled sketch of ratchet teeth
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Adult supervises recoil spring; keep fingers clear
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
