### Energy forms; rubber band car

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Build a rubber band car; observe energy conversion to motion
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Lightweight wheels (bottle caps), skewers/axles, rubber band, chassis (card)
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Build simple rubber band car; wind and release (30–40 min)
2) Measure distance vs number of winds (10–15 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Supervise skewers; avoid snapping bands toward face
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
