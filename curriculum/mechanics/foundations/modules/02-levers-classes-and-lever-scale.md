### Levers: classes and lever scale

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify 3 classes of levers and mechanical advantage concept
- Build a simple lever scale and compare weights
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Ruler or wood strip (lever), pencil/dowel (fulcrum), coins/washers (weights), tape
- Examples at home: door (Class 2 hinge orientation discussion), pliers (Class 1), wheelbarrow (Class 2)
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Lever, fulcrum, load, effort, mechanical advantage
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- How does moving the fulcrum change the effort required?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate your lever and explain why it makes work easier
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Identify lever classes with pictures/objects (15 min)
2) Build lever scale; mark distances; test coin weights (30–40 min)
3) Measure “effort arm” vs “load arm”; record observations (15 min)
4) Notebook, teach‑back, Stop Here (20 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch lever with labels; one sentence on advantage when effort arm is longer
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- No sharp edges; keep lever stable to avoid pinches
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
