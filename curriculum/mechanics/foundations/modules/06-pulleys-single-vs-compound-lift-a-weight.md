### Pulleys: single vs compound; lift a weight

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Compare fixed vs movable pulleys and observe mechanical advantage
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- 2–3 small pulleys, cord, hook, light weights (water bottle), anchor point, tape
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Fixed pulley, movable pulley, block and tackle, load, effort
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- Why does adding a pulley make the lift easier but require more rope?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate a two‑pulley system and explain the trade‑off
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Set up fixed pulley; lift weight; count effort (10 min)
2) Set up two‑pulley system; repeat; compare (20–25 min)
3) Mark rope distance moved vs weight height; record (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Table comparing effort and rope distance for 1 vs 2 pulleys
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Keep toes clear of falling weight; check knots
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
