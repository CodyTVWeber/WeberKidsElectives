### Valves & flow; syringe check valve

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Build a simple one‑way valve and observe directional flow
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Two syringes, soft tubing, small ball (bead) and seat (tubing pinch) or commercial one‑way valve
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Valve, check valve, flow, pressure
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Assemble simple check valve; test one‑way flow (20–25 min)
2) Discuss how valves control fluids in engines (5–10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Use clean components; no mouth contact
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
