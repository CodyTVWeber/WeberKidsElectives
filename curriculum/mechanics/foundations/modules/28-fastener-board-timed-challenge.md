### Fastener board timed challenge

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify and match fasteners quickly and accurately
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Screw ID board from Week 5; timer; driver bits; labels
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Timed matching: pick correct bit and seat without cam‑out (15–20 min)
2) Review misses; add notes to the board (10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- No rushing that causes slips; stop if bit jumps
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
