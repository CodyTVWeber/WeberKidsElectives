### Tool care and storage; torque respect

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Clean, organize, and store tools; feel proper snug vs overtight
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Screwdrivers, small wrench, rag, light oil; tool board or box
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Wipe and oil metal; return tools to labeled spots (20–25 min)
2) Torque by feel drill on scrap (snug, not stripped) (15–20 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Minimal oil; wipe hands before handling other items
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
