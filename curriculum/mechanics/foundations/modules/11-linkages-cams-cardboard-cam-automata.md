### Linkages & cams; cardboard cam automata

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Build a simple cam and follower; convert rotary to reciprocating motion
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Cardboard, skewer/dowel, cam templates, straw (bearing), glue/tape, scissors (adult assists)
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Cam, follower, linkage, reciprocating
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Cut cam shapes; mount on dowel; follower from straw (30–40 min)
2) Observe motion; adjust cam shape; record effect (15 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Adult handles sharp cutting
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
