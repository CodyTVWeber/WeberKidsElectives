### Bearings & bushings; fidget spinner teardown

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Compare bearing vs bushing; observe reduced friction
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Fidget spinner with removable bearing; plain sleeve tube; lubricant drop
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Bearing, bushing, lubrication, friction
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Remove bearing; inspect balls/cage; spin tests (20–25 min)
2) Compare to plain sleeve tube; note spin time (10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Small parts hazard; contain
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
