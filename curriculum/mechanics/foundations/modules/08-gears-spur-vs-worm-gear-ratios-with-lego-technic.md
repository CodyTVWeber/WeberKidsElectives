### Gears: spur vs worm; gear ratios with LEGO/Technic

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Build simple gear trains; measure speed and torque trade‑off
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- LEGO/Technic gears and beams; optional worm gear; small weight; stopwatch
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Spur gear, worm gear, gear ratio, torque, mesh
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- Why does a higher gear ratio increase torque but reduce speed?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate a gear train and explain its ratio
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Build 1:1 gear train; note speed (10 min)
2) Build 3:1 reduction; compare turn count and lifting ability (30–40 min)
3) Try worm gear; note one‑way behavior (optional) (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch gear train with tooth counts; compute ratio (driven/driver)
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Keep small parts contained; no mouth contact
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
