### Wheel & axle; toy car teardown

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify wheel & axle; observe reduction of friction
- Disassemble a toy car and reassemble correctly
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Simple toy car with screws, small screwdrivers, zip bags, labels
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Wheel, axle, bearing, friction
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- How does wheel diameter affect travel per turn?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Show a wheel & axle and describe how it helps movement
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Spin tests: slide vs roll (10 min)
2) Teardown toy car; photo each stage; bag fasteners (45 min)
3) Reassemble; check rolling performance (20–30 min)
4) Notebook and Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch axle with wheels; label; note change after reassembly
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Keep small parts contained; magnet tray prevents loss
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
