### Clutches & friction; spinning disk demo

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- See how friction transmits motion and can slip to protect parts
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Spinning top or small turntable; felt pads; rubber disk; light weights
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Friction, clutch, slip, engagement
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Spin base; apply felt vs rubber to transfer motion (15–20 min)
2) Add weight/pressure; observe slip point (10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Keep fingers clear of fast rotation
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
