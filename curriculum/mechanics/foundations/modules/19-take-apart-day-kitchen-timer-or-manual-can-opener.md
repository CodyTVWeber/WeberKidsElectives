Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Full teardown with organization; identify at least 3 mechanisms
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Broken kitchen timer or manual can opener; trays; bags; labels; camera
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Before photo; external inspection (5 min)
2) Teardown in stages with photos; bag/label fasteners (60–75 min)
3) Identify mechanisms (gear train, spring, ratchet) (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Tape sharp edges; supervise
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
