### Practicum: wind‑up toy full teardown/rebuild

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Plan and execute a full teardown/rebuild with photos and labels
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Wind‑up toy (geared); trays; bags; labels; camera
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Before photo; identify fasteners; open case (10–15 min)
2) Stage photos; parts layout; clean; reassemble (60–75 min)
3) Test and adjust; Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Control springs; small parts contained
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
