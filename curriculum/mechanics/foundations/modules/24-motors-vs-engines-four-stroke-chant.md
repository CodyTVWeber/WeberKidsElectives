### Motors vs engines; four‑stroke chant

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Distinguish electric motor from combustion engine; memorize 4‑stroke sequence
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Picture cards of motors/engines; simple 4‑stroke diagram; chant or song
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Sort pictures: motor vs engine; discuss energy sources (15–20 min)
2) Teach four‑stroke chant: intake, compression, power, exhaust (10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)
