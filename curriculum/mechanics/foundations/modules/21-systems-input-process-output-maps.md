### Systems: input‑process‑output maps

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Think in systems; identify inputs, process, outputs on household devices
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Index cards; markers; 2 chosen devices (e.g., toaster, faucet)
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Procedure
1) Define system; map two examples with 3‑box diagram (20–25 min)
2) Discuss failure modes: if no output, which input/process could fail? (10 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)
