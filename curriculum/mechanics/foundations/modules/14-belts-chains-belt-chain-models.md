### Belts & chains; belt/chain models

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Model belt vs chain drive; discuss tension and alignment
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Rubber band belts; linked chain model (toy links); two pulleys/sprockets
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Belt, chain, sprocket, tension, alignment
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Build belt drive; test slip under load (15–20 min)
2) Build simple chain; test engagement under load (15–20 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Keep fingers out of moving loops
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
