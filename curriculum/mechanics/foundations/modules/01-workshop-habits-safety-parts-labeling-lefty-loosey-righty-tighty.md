### Workshop habits & safety; parts labeling; lefty‑loosey/righty‑tighty

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`, `../../templates/engineers-notebook-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Establish safety rules and workspace routines
- Practice screwdriver control and fastener direction
- Learn to bag/label parts and take progress photos
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)
- Document observations using engineering notebook best practices
- Develop systematic troubleshooting approaches
- Connect mechanical principles to everyday devices
#### Materials (prep)
- PPE (glasses, closed‑toe shoes), magnetic parts tray, zip bags, painter’s tape/labels, markers
- Assorted screws/bolts, two scrap boards with pilot holes
- Take‑apart: click pen and one simple toy (no sharp edges)
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed
- Digital camera or tablet for documentation
- Storage bins for sorted components
- Reference posters for tool names and safety rules
#### Grammar (vocab)
- PPE, torque, fastener, clockwise/counterclockwise, organize
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance
- Assembly, disassembly, component
- Force, motion, energy transfer
- Efficiency, optimization, constraint
#### Logic prompts
- If a screw won’t turn, what might be wrong? (bit size, direction, seized)
- Why label bags even if there are only a few parts?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?
- What would happen if this part was made of a different material?
- How could you make this mechanism more efficient?
- What safety considerations apply to this design?
#### Rhetoric (teach‑back)
- Explain to a family member how to keep parts organized during teardown

- Present at a mini science fair with demonstrations
- Create an instruction manual with photos and diagrams
- Film a 'how it works' explanation video
#### Procedure (2–3 hours)
1) Review rules; set up PPE and trays (10 min)
2) Lefty‑loosey drill: loosen/tighten into scrap boards; change bits (20 min)
3) Click pen teardown: photos → bag/label → reassemble (30 min)
4) Toy teardown: identify 3 parts; photos; partial reassembly (45–60 min)
5) Teach‑back (3 min) and notebook entry (10 min)
6) Cleanup and Stop Here (10 min)
7) Documentation: Update engineering notebook with findings (5 min)
8) Peer review: Explain your mechanism to a partner (5 min)
9) Clean-up protocol: Sort and store all components properly (5 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Pre-sort components by type or size
- Support: Provide step-by-step visual instruction cards
- Support: Work with a peer mentor for complex assemblies
- Challenge: Design modifications to improve the mechanism
- Challenge: Calculate mechanical advantage or gear ratios
- Challenge: Create technical drawings with proper conventions
- Fine motor support: Use larger fasteners or adaptive tools
#### Portfolio
- Notebook: date, objective, labeled sketch of toy with 3 parts, two sentences, next step
- Photo log: before/after and parts layout
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement
- Detailed sketches from multiple angles with measurements
- Photo sequence showing assembly/disassembly process
- Written explanation of how the mechanism works

#### Assessment
- Safety check: Demonstrate proper tool handling before starting
- Process observation: Note systematic approach and organization
- Notebook review: Check for complete documentation and labeled diagrams
- Functionality test: Does the mechanism work as intended?
- Peer review: Partner evaluates build quality and documentation
- Troubleshooting skills: Can student identify and fix common issues?
- Portfolio evidence: Clear photos and written explanations of learning

#### Home Connection
- Take-apart permission: Identify safe household items to explore
- Tool time: Practice skills while helping with home repairs
- Engineering walks: Identify simple machines in the neighborhood
- Family builder challenge: Work together on construction projects
- Share learning: Explain mechanisms found in everyday objects
#### Safety
- Adult controls sharp edges; stop on any pinch/strip; tools back to home after use
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
