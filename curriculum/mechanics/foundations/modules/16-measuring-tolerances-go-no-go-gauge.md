### Measuring & tolerances; go/no‑go gauge

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Practice measuring; understand tolerance; build a simple go/no‑go gauge
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Ruler/tape, calipers (optional), scrap card/wood, drill bits/dowels
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Measure, tolerance, fit, go/no‑go
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Measure household items; record to nearest 1/8 in or mm (15–20 min)
2) Make a go/no‑go: two holes sized slightly different; test dowel (25–30 min)
3) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
4) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
5) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
6) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Adult handles drilling
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
