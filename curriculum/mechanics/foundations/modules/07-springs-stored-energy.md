### Springs & stored energy

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Observe compression and tension springs; relate to stored energy
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)
- Document observations using engineering notebook best practices
- Develop systematic troubleshooting approaches
- Connect mechanical principles to everyday devices
#### Materials
- Assorted springs (pen, clothespin, slinky), rubber bands, small weights, ruler
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed
- Digital camera or tablet for documentation
- Storage bins for sorted components
- Reference posters for tool names and safety rules
#### Grammar
- Compression spring, tension spring, elastic potential energy, deflection
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance
- Assembly, disassembly, component
- Force, motion, energy transfer
- Efficiency, optimization, constraint
#### Logic
- What happens to stored energy when the spring is released?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?
- What would happen if this part was made of a different material?
- How could you make this mechanism more efficient?
- What safety considerations apply to this design?
#### Rhetoric
- Show a spring demo and explain how energy is stored and released
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

- Present at a mini science fair with demonstrations
- Create an instruction manual with photos and diagrams
- Film a 'how it works' explanation video
#### Procedure
1) Sort springs by type; simple stretch/compress tests (10–15 min)
2) Hang a weight from rubber bands; measure stretch vs weight (20 min)
3) Use clothespin as a simple spring clamp; discuss work (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)
8) Documentation: Update engineering notebook with findings (5 min)
9) Peer review: Explain your mechanism to a partner (5 min)
10) Clean-up protocol: Sort and store all components properly (5 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Pre-sort components by type or size
- Support: Provide step-by-step visual instruction cards
- Support: Work with a peer mentor for complex assemblies
- Challenge: Design modifications to improve the mechanism
- Challenge: Calculate mechanical advantage or gear ratios
- Challenge: Create technical drawings with proper conventions
- Fine motor support: Use larger fasteners or adaptive tools
#### Portfolio
- Sketch compression vs tension spring; one observation sentence each
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement
- Detailed sketches from multiple angles with measurements
- Photo sequence showing assembly/disassembly process
- Written explanation of how the mechanism works

#### Assessment
- Safety check: Demonstrate proper tool handling before starting
- Process observation: Note systematic approach and organization
- Notebook review: Check for complete documentation and labeled diagrams
- Functionality test: Does the mechanism work as intended?
- Peer review: Partner evaluates build quality and documentation
- Troubleshooting skills: Can student identify and fix common issues?
- Portfolio evidence: Clear photos and written explanations of learning

#### Home Connection
- Take-apart permission: Identify safe household items to explore
- Tool time: Practice skills while helping with home repairs
- Engineering walks: Identify simple machines in the neighborhood
- Family builder challenge: Work together on construction projects
- Share learning: Explain mechanisms found in everyday objects
#### Safety
- Control slinky/snaps; keep eyes protected
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
