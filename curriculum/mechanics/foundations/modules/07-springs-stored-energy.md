### Springs & stored energy

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Observe compression and tension springs; relate to stored energy
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Assorted springs (pen, clothespin, slinky), rubber bands, small weights, ruler
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Compression spring, tension spring, elastic potential energy, deflection
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- What happens to stored energy when the spring is released?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Show a spring demo and explain how energy is stored and released
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Sort springs by type; simple stretch/compress tests (10–15 min)
2) Hang a weight from rubber bands; measure stretch vs weight (20 min)
3) Use clothespin as a simple spring clamp; discuss work (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch compression vs tension spring; one observation sentence each
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Control slinky/snaps; keep eyes protected
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
