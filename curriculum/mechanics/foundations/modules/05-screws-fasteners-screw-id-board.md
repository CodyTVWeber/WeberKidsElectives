### Screws & fasteners; screw ID board

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify common fastener heads and sizes; practice correct driver selection
- Build a simple screw ID board for future matching
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- Assorted screws/bolts/nuts (Phillips, slotted, Torx, hex), scrap board, drill (adult), labels
- Driver set: Phillips, flat, Torx, hex; painter’s tape; marker
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Thread, pitch, head, driver bit, metric/SAE
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Logic
- What happens if the bit does not fit the head perfectly? Why?
- What changes if you double the gear ratio or lever arm?
- How do you ensure parts go back in the correct order?

#### Rhetoric
- Explain how to choose the right driver for a screw
- Explain your build or teardown to a visitor using the notebook

#### Procedure
1) Sort fasteners by head type; match to driver bits (15–20 min)
2) Adult pre‑drills pilot holes; child installs sample screws; label each (30–40 min)
3) Create a quick reference label: “If it cams out, stop and change bit” (5 min)
4) Notebook entry; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of screw ID board; sketch with two labeled head types
- Add a labeled diagram with arrows; include one quantitative measurement

#### Safety
- Adult handles drilling; keep fingers away from screw tips
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
