### Mini‑capstone: Simple Machines Museum

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Curate 3–4 exhibits (lever, pulley, gear, wedge) and present
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)
- Document observations using engineering notebook best practices
- Develop systematic troubleshooting approaches
- Connect mechanical principles to everyday devices
#### Materials
- Items built in Weeks 2–9; labels/cards; table for display; camera
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed
- Digital camera or tablet for documentation
- Storage bins for sorted components
- Reference posters for tool names and safety rules
#### Procedure
1) Select exhibits and set them up with labels (20–30 min)
2) Rehearse 1–2 sentences per exhibit (10 min)
3) Family demo (10 min)
4) Notebook reflection; Stop Here (15 min)
5) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
6) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
7) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)
8) Documentation: Update engineering notebook with findings (5 min)
9) Peer review: Explain your mechanism to a partner (5 min)
10) Clean-up protocol: Sort and store all components properly (5 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Pre-sort components by type or size
- Support: Provide step-by-step visual instruction cards
- Support: Work with a peer mentor for complex assemblies
- Challenge: Design modifications to improve the mechanism
- Challenge: Calculate mechanical advantage or gear ratios
- Challenge: Create technical drawings with proper conventions
- Fine motor support: Use larger fasteners or adaptive tools
#### Assessment
- Can identify machine and tell how it makes work easier
