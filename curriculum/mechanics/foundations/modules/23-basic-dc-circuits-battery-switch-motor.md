### Basic DC circuits: battery, switch, motor

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Safely wire a simple DC circuit to spin a motor via switch
- Sketch and label parts with arrows showing motion/force flow
- Compare two designs for trade‑offs (speed, torque, complexity)

#### Materials
- AA battery holder, small DC motor, switch, jumper leads, tape
- Ruler or calipers; painter’s tape for labels; safety glasses as needed

#### Grammar
- Circuit, series, polarity, switch
- Input
- Output
- Trade‑off
- Tolerance

#### Procedure
1) Wire battery → switch → motor; observe spin and polarity reversal (25–30 min)
2) Notebook; Stop Here (10–15 min)
3) Plan: predict outcome/ratio and note in notebook (5–7 min)
4) Test: run trial, record observations and measurements (8–10 min)
5) Iterate: make one change and compare results (8–10 min)

#### Safety
- Low voltage only; no mains; avoid short circuits
- Wear eye protection when appropriate; no loose hair/jewelry near moving parts
