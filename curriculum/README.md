### Mechanics Curriculum (progression-focused, ages 6–16)

This folder contains a progression-first mechanics curriculum with a classical approach (Grammar → Logic → Rhetoric). Age ranges are suggestions; proceed at your learner’s pace. Safety and resources are provided separately.

#### Start here
- Foundations topics (suggested ages 6–7) overview: `year-1/syllabus.md`
- Weekly session template: `templates/weekly-session-template.md`
- Stop Here checklist: `templates/stop-here-checklist.md`
- Engineer’s notebook template: `templates/engineers-notebook-template.md`
- Safety guide: `safety.md`
- Resources and kits: `resources.md`
- Progression beyond foundations (suggested ages 7–14): `years-2-6-outline.md`

#### Also in this repo (reference plans)
- Alternative comprehensive plans located in `Theo/`:
  - `Theo/Comprehensive_Mechanical_Engine_Work_Learning_Plan (1).markdown`
  - `Theo/Flattened_Mechanical_Engine_Work_Learning_Plan (1).markdown`

Use the `Theo/` plans as supplementary reading; this curriculum emphasizes stop-and-resume checkpoints and progression over time blocks.

#### Build a single progression document
- Compose a single Markdown (and optional PDF) from the nested files:
  - Run: `scripts/build_curriculum.py`
  - Output: `build/progression.md` (and `build/progression.pdf` if `pandoc` is installed)
