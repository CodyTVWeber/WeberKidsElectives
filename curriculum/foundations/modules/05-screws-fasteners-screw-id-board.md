### Screws & fasteners; screw ID board

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify common fastener heads and sizes; practice correct driver selection
- Build a simple screw ID board for future matching

#### Materials
- Assorted screws/bolts/nuts (Phillips, slotted, Torx, hex), scrap board, drill (adult), labels
- Driver set: Phillips, flat, Torx, hex; painter’s tape; marker

#### Grammar
- Thread, pitch, head, driver bit, metric/SAE

#### Logic
- What happens if the bit does not fit the head perfectly? Why?

#### Rhetoric
- Explain how to choose the right driver for a screw

#### Procedure
1) Sort fasteners by head type; match to driver bits (15–20 min)
2) Adult pre‑drills pilot holes; child installs sample screws; label each (30–40 min)
3) Create a quick reference label: “If it cams out, stop and change bit” (5 min)
4) Notebook entry; Stop Here (15 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of screw ID board; sketch with two labeled head types

#### Safety
- Adult handles drilling; keep fingers away from screw tips
