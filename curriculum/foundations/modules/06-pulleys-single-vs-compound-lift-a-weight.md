### Pulleys: single vs compound; lift a weight

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Compare fixed vs movable pulleys and observe mechanical advantage

#### Materials
- 2–3 small pulleys, cord, hook, light weights (water bottle), anchor point, tape

#### Grammar
- Fixed pulley, movable pulley, block and tackle, load, effort

#### Logic
- Why does adding a pulley make the lift easier but require more rope?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate a two‑pulley system and explain the trade‑off

#### Procedure
1) Set up fixed pulley; lift weight; count effort (10 min)
2) Set up two‑pulley system; repeat; compare (20–25 min)
3) Mark rope distance moved vs weight height; record (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)

#### Portfolio
- Table comparing effort and rope distance for 1 vs 2 pulleys

#### Safety
- Keep toes clear of falling weight; check knots
