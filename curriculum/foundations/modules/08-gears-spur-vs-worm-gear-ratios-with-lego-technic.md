### Gears: spur vs worm; gear ratios with LEGO/Technic

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Build simple gear trains; measure speed and torque trade‑off

#### Materials
- LEGO/Technic gears and beams; optional worm gear; small weight; stopwatch

#### Grammar
- Spur gear, worm gear, gear ratio, torque, mesh

#### Logic
- Why does a higher gear ratio increase torque but reduce speed?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate a gear train and explain its ratio

#### Procedure
1) Build 1:1 gear train; note speed (10 min)
2) Build 3:1 reduction; compare turn count and lifting ability (30–40 min)
3) Try worm gear; note one‑way behavior (optional) (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch gear train with tooth counts; compute ratio (driven/driver)

#### Safety
- Keep small parts contained; no mouth contact
