### Levers: classes and lever scale

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify 3 classes of levers and mechanical advantage concept
- Build a simple lever scale and compare weights

#### Materials
- Ruler or wood strip (lever), pencil/dowel (fulcrum), coins/washers (weights), tape
- Examples at home: door (Class 2 hinge orientation discussion), pliers (Class 1), wheelbarrow (Class 2)

#### Grammar
- Lever, fulcrum, load, effort, mechanical advantage

#### Logic
- How does moving the fulcrum change the effort required?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate your lever and explain why it makes work easier

#### Procedure
1) Identify lever classes with pictures/objects (15 min)
2) Build lever scale; mark distances; test coin weights (30–40 min)
3) Measure “effort arm” vs “load arm”; record observations (15 min)
4) Notebook, teach‑back, Stop Here (20 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch lever with labels; one sentence on advantage when effort arm is longer

#### Safety
- No sharp edges; keep lever stable to avoid pinches
