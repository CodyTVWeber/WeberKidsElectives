#### Materials
- Old tape measure (adult pre‑tapes sharp edges), socket wrench ratchet, gloves, labels

#### Procedure
1) Demonstrate socket ratchet directions (10 min)
2) Carefully open tape measure case; photo; identify recoil spring (30 min)
3) Close and test lock; discuss dangers of spring energy (5 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)

#### Portfolio
