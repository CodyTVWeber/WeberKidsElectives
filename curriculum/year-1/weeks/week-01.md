### Week 01 — Workshop habits & safety; parts labeling; lefty‑loosey/righty‑tighty

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`, `../../templates/engineers-notebook-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Establish safety rules and workspace routines
- Practice screwdriver control and fastener direction
- Learn to bag/label parts and take progress photos

#### Materials (prep)
- PPE (glasses, closed‑toe shoes), magnetic parts tray, zip bags, painter’s tape/labels, markers
- Assorted screws/bolts, two scrap boards with pilot holes
- Take‑apart: click pen and one simple toy (no sharp edges)

#### Grammar (vocab)
- PPE, torque, fastener, clockwise/counterclockwise, organize

#### Logic prompts
- If a screw won’t turn, what might be wrong? (bit size, direction, seized)
- Why label bags even if there are only a few parts?

#### Rhetoric (teach‑back)
- Explain to a family member how to keep parts organized during teardown

#### Procedure (2–3 hours)
1) Review rules; set up PPE and trays (10 min)
2) Lefty‑loosey drill: loosen/tighten into scrap boards; change bits (20 min)
3) Click pen teardown: photos → bag/label → reassemble (30 min)
4) Toy teardown: identify 3 parts; photos; partial reassembly (45–60 min)
5) Teach‑back (3 min) and notebook entry (10 min)
6) Cleanup and Stop Here (10 min)

#### Portfolio
- Notebook: date, objective, labeled sketch of toy with 3 parts, two sentences, next step
- Photo log: before/after and parts layout

#### Safety
- Adult controls sharp edges; stop on any pinch/strip; tools back to home after use
