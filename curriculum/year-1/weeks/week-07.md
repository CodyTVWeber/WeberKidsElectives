### Week 07 — Springs & stored energy

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Observe compression and tension springs; relate to stored energy

#### Materials
- Assorted springs (pen, clothespin, slinky), rubber bands, small weights, ruler

#### Grammar
- Compression spring, tension spring, elastic potential energy, deflection

#### Logic
- What happens to stored energy when the spring is released?

#### Rhetoric
- Show a spring demo and explain how energy is stored and released

#### Procedure
1) Sort springs by type; simple stretch/compress tests (10–15 min)
2) Hang a weight from rubber bands; measure stretch vs weight (20 min)
3) Use clothespin as a simple spring clamp; discuss work (10 min)
4) Notebook; Stop Here (15 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch compression vs tension spring; one observation sentence each

#### Safety
- Control slinky/snaps; keep eyes protected
