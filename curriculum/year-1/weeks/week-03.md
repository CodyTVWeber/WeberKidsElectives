### Week 03 — Inclined plane & wedge; ramp tests

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`

#### Objectives
- Describe how ramps reduce required force over distance
- Compare ramp angles and rolling distance/speed

#### Materials
- Board/books to form ramps; toy car; protractor or angle estimates; soap bar as wedge; tape

#### Grammar
- Inclined plane, wedge, angle, friction

#### Logic
- Why is it easier to push up a long gentle ramp than a short steep one?

#### Rhetoric
- Explain your ramp test results to a family member

#### Procedure
1) Build two ramp angles; predict which is easier (10 min)
2) Test car roll; measure distance/speed (25 min)
3) Explore wedge splitting (soap) vs pushing straight in (10 min)
4) Notebook, photos, Stop Here (15–20 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch ramp; label angle; write 2 findings

#### Safety
- Stabilize ramps; keep fingers clear
