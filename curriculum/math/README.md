### Math Curriculum (progression-based)

Mirrors the mechanics and music structures: foundations modules, a simple syllabus outline, templates, resources, and a builder that composes one progression doc without time references. Suggested age ranges guide readiness.

Use these with `templates/` and `foundations/syllabus.md`. The `scripts/build_math.py` script writes `build/math-progression.md`.
