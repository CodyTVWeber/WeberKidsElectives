### Foundations syllabus (suggested ages ~4–8)

Progression modules move concrete → pictorial → abstract, with manipulatives first. Use the math session template and end with the Stop Here checklist.

#### Theme 1: Number sense to ten
1. Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence
2. Number bonds to 10 (pairs that make 10)
3. Ten‑frames and subitizing (see quantities at a glance)
4. Addition within 10 (count on, make‑10)
5. Subtraction within 10 (count back, think addition)

#### Theme 2: Place value and beyond ten
6. Compose/decompose numbers with base‑ten blocks
7. Place value: tens and ones; expanded form
8. Skip‑count by 2s/5s/10s; even/odd
 9. Doubles and near‑doubles strategies
10. Story problems; bar models and number bonds

#### Theme 3: Operations and models
11. Measurement: length comparison and nonstandard units

13. Money: identify coins and count like coins
14. Geometry: 2D shapes, attributes, composing shapes
15. Data: tally marks and picture graphs
16. Comparing numbers and number line (0–100)
17. Add within 20 (make‑10 and bridge‑10)
18. Subtract within 20 (think addition and bridge‑10)
19. Intro to arrays and equal groups (pre‑multiplication)
