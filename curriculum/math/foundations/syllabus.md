### Foundations syllabus (suggested ages ~4–8)

Progression modules move concrete → pictorial → abstract, with manipulatives first. Use the math session template and end with the Stop Here checklist.

#### Theme 1: Number sense to ten
1. Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence
2. Number bonds to 10 (pairs that make 10)
3. Ten‑frames and subitizing (see quantities at a glance)
4. Addition within 10 (count on, make‑10)
5. Subtraction within 10 (count back, think addition)

#### Theme 2: Place value and beyond ten
6. Compose/decompose numbers with base‑ten blocks
7. Place value: tens and ones; expanded form
8. Skip‑count by 2s/5s/10s; even/odd

#### Theme 3: Operations and models
9. Doubles and near‑doubles strategies
10. Story problems; bar models and number bonds
