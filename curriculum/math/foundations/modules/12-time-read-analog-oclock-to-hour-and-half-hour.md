### Time: read analog o'clock to hour and half‑hour

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Read and set times to the hour and half‑hour on an analog clock
- Explain hour hand vs minute hand roles
- Connect daily routines to clock times
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Analog clock with movable hands; routine cards
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Hour hand, minute hand, o'clock, half‑past
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Why does the hour hand point between numbers at half‑past?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show two routine times and read them on the clock
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Identify hands; set times; read aloud
2) Match routine cards to clock settings
3) Practice: set five random times to hour/half‑hour
4) Stop Here: draw one clock and label the time
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Clock drawing with labels and a sentence
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Gentle handling of clock; store safely
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
