### Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Count objects up to 20 with one touch per item
- Say the last number as the total (cardinality)
- Arrange objects into lines or ten‑frames
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, small toys, or blocks; ten‑frames; number cards 0–20
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Count, one‑to‑one, total, more, fewer, equal
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How do you know you didn’t skip or double‑count?
- Why does the last number you say tell the total?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain to a family member how lining up objects helps counting
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up count 1–20; place one counter per ten‑frame box
2) Match number cards to sets; check by touching each object once
3) Mixed practice: scramble, line up, recount; discuss total
4) Stop Here: circle a number that felt “just right” to count
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of ten‑frame with labeled number; short reflection sentence
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Small parts caution; keep away from mouths and younger siblings
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
