### Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Count objects up to 20 with one touch per item
- Say the last number as the total (cardinality)
- Arrange objects into lines or ten‑frames

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, small toys, or blocks; ten‑frames; number cards 0–20

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Count, one‑to‑one, total, more, fewer, equal

#### Logic prompts
- How do you know you didn’t skip or double‑count?
- Why does the last number you say tell the total?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain to a family member how lining up objects helps counting

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up count 1–20; place one counter per ten‑frame box
2) Match number cards to sets; check by touching each object once
3) Mixed practice: scramble, line up, recount; discuss total
4) Stop Here: circle a number that felt “just right” to count

#### Portfolio
- Photo of ten‑frame with labeled number; short reflection sentence

#### Safety
- Small parts caution; keep away from mouths and younger siblings
