### Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Count objects up to 20 with one touch per item, maintaining consistent pace and rhythm
- Say the last number as the total (cardinality) and understand this represents the entire set
- Arrange objects into lines or ten‑frames, recognizing patterns of 5 and 10
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations, tally marks) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner using mathematical language
- Recognize counting errors (skipping, double-counting) and self-correct independently
- Connect counting to real-world contexts (toys, snacks, classroom materials)
- Apply learned concepts to real-world problem-solving scenarios
- Develop mathematical communication skills through peer discussions
- Build confidence in explaining mathematical reasoning
#### Materials (prep)
- Counters in multiple colors (at least 30), small toys, or blocks; laminated ten‑frames; number cards 0–20
- Number line strips (0-20); dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes for labeling
- Collection cups or small containers for sorting; dice (standard and dot patterns)
- Real objects for counting practice (crayons, buttons, coins, beans)
- Grid paper for creating custom ten-frames; recording sheets for practice
- Timer for pacing activities; clipboard for recording work
- Manipulative storage containers with labels
- Assessment rubric and progress tracking sheet
#### Grammar (vocab)
- Count, one‑to‑one, total, more, fewer, equal, compare
- Equation, number sentence, equals sign
- Representation, model, diagram
- Efficient, strategy, method
- Cardinality, quantity, set
- Organize, arrange, pattern
- Skip, double-count, check
- Strategy, method, approach, solution path
- Verify, prove, justify, explain
- Pattern, sequence, relationship
#### Logic prompts
- How do you know you didn't skip or double‑count? What strategy did you use?
- Why does the last number you say tell the total? Can you prove it?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame? Give an example.
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable? What clues help you?
- What happens if you count the same objects in a different order?
- How is counting by touching different from counting by looking?
- Why do we line up objects before counting them?
- Can you think of a time when counting backwards would be useful?
- What patterns do you notice? How could you extend them?
- If you changed one part of the problem, how would the answer change?
- Can you create a similar problem for a partner to solve?
#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain to a family member how lining up objects helps counting and demonstrate with real items
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio, using math vocabulary
- Create a mini-poster showing three different ways to count the same set of objects
- Teach a younger sibling or friend how to count using one-to-one correspondence
- Present your favorite counting strategy to the class with visual aids

- Create a math tutorial video for the class library
- Design a poster explaining your favorite strategy
- Write a letter to next year's students with helpful tips
#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up count 1–20 forward and backward; place one counter per ten‑frame box, noticing patterns of 5 and 10 (5 min)
2) Match number cards to sets; check by touching each object once with pencil or finger; verbalize the count (7 min)
3) Mixed practice: scramble objects, line up in different ways, recount; discuss if total changes (8 min)
4) Counting race: Partner A arranges 12-15 objects, Partner B counts and checks; switch roles (10 min)
5) Stop Here: circle a number that felt "just right" to count; draw your counting strategy
6) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud, using different representations (8–10 min)
7) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model; must use at least 2 different strategies (10–12 min)
8) Challenge extension: Count collections of mixed objects (buttons and beans); sort first or count mixed? (5 min)
9) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy using math vocabulary (3–5 min)
10) Exit ticket: Count a mystery bag of objects; write the total and one thing you noticed
11) Partner check: Exchange work and verify each other's solutions (5 min)
12) Extension activity for early finishers: Create your own problem (optional)
13) Gallery walk: Display work and observe different solution strategies (5 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Provide number lines, hundred charts, or concrete manipulatives
- Support: Reduce number range (work within 10 instead of 20)
- Support: Offer sentence starters for mathematical explanations
- Challenge: Add constraints (solve without manipulatives)
- Challenge: Create word problems for given equations
- Challenge: Find multiple solution strategies and compare efficiency
- English Learners: Use visual models and gesture alongside vocabulary
#### Portfolio
- Photo of ten‑frame with labeled number; short reflection sentence about counting strategy
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used (ten-frame, number line, or tally marks)
- Collection of 3 counting recordings showing different arrangements of the same quantity
- Written comparison of two counting methods with drawings
- "Counting Expert" certificate after demonstrating accurate counting to 20 with self-checking
- Video explanation of problem-solving process (1-2 minutes)
- Collection of different solution methods with annotations
- Self-assessment rubric completion with evidence

#### Assessment
- Pre-assessment: Quick verbal check of prerequisite skills (2-3 questions)
- Formative: Observe and note student strategies during independent work
- Peer assessment: Partner checking with provided answer key
- Self-assessment: Students rate their confidence level (1-5) on each skill
- Exit ticket: One problem demonstrating the main concept
- Success criteria: 80% accuracy on independent practice problems
- Documentation: Photo of best work sample for portfolio

#### Home Connection
- Family math night: Play counting games together (board games, card games)
- Real-world practice: Count items while cooking or shopping
- Share strategies: Ask family members how they solve similar problems
- Math journal: Keep a book of interesting math discoveries
- Celebrate growth: Display best work on refrigerator or bulletin board
#### Safety
- Small parts caution; keep away from mouths and younger siblings (counters can be choking hazards)
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly in labeled containers
- Wash hands before and after using shared manipulatives
- Use placemats or trays to contain materials and prevent rolling objects
- Check floor for dropped items before transitioning to next activity
