### Addition within 10 (count on, make‑10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Add within 10 by counting on from the larger addend
- Use make‑10 strategy with ten‑frames and number bonds
- Explain why both strategies give the same sum
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, two‑color counters, number cards 0–10, number bond templates
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Add, sum, count on, make‑10, parts and whole
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Why is it faster to start with the bigger number and count on?
- How does make‑10 help with 8 + 2 or 7 + 3?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach a family member 6 + 4 two ways (count on, make‑10)
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up: quick facts up to 5 + 5 using counters
2) Model count‑on on a ten‑frame; start from larger addend
3) Model make‑10 using number bonds (e.g., 7 + 3 → 10)
4) Mixed practice: draw, build, and write equations
5) Stop Here: circle one strategy you prefer today
6) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
7) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
8) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of a solved pair using both strategies and a one‑sentence explanation
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep counters away from mouths; tidy pieces between problems
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
