### Addition within 10 (count on, make‑10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Add within 10 by counting on from the larger addend
- Use make‑10 strategy with ten‑frames and number bonds
- Explain why both strategies give the same sum

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, two‑color counters, number cards 0–10, number bond templates

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Add, sum, count on, make‑10, parts and whole

#### Logic prompts
- Why is it faster to start with the bigger number and count on?
- How does make‑10 help with 8 + 2 or 7 + 3?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach a family member 6 + 4 two ways (count on, make‑10)

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up: quick facts up to 5 + 5 using counters
2) Model count‑on on a ten‑frame; start from larger addend
3) Model make‑10 using number bonds (e.g., 7 + 3 → 10)
4) Mixed practice: draw, build, and write equations
5) Stop Here: circle one strategy you prefer today

#### Portfolio
- Photo of a solved pair using both strategies and a one‑sentence explanation

#### Safety
- Keep counters away from mouths; tidy pieces between problems
