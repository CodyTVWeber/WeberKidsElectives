Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Fluently add within 20 using make‑10 and bridge‑10 on a number line
- Explain composing a new ten
- Choose efficient strategies for different problems

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, number line, counters, whiteboard

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Compose a ten, bridge‑10, efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Why is 9 + 7 easier if you move 1 from 7 to make 10 first?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Demonstrate two ways to solve 8 + 9 and justify your choice

#### Procedure
1) Review make‑10 with frames; extend to 11–20 sums
2) Bridge‑10 jumps on number line; narrate steps
3) Mixed practice; circle the most efficient strategy
4) Stop Here: write one reflection about when you use which

#### Portfolio
- One solved problem with both models and a sentence

#### Safety
- Organize counters; cap markers
