### Add within 20 (make‑10 and bridge‑10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Fluently add within 20 using make‑10 and bridge‑10 on a number line
- Explain composing a new ten
- Choose efficient strategies for different problems
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, number line, counters, whiteboard
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Compose a ten, bridge‑10, efficient
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Why is 9 + 7 easier if you move 1 from 7 to make 10 first?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Demonstrate two ways to solve 8 + 9 and justify your choice
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Review make‑10 with frames; extend to 11–20 sums
2) Bridge‑10 jumps on number line; narrate steps
3) Mixed practice; circle the most efficient strategy
4) Stop Here: write one reflection about when you use which
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- One solved problem with both models and a sentence
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Organize counters; cap markers
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
