### Doubles and near‑doubles strategies

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Recall doubles within 20 (e.g., 6 + 6)
- Use near‑doubles (e.g., 6 + 7 as 6 + 6 + 1)
- Explain why near‑doubles work using models

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, number line, whiteboard, dot cards

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Double, near‑double, adjust, strategy

#### Logic prompts
- How can knowing 8 + 8 help solve 8 + 9 quickly?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach one near‑double with a visual model

#### Procedure
1) Review doubles with flash cards or dot cards
2) Model near‑doubles on number line and with counters
3) Practice mixed problems; explain adjustments aloud
4) Stop Here: star the strategy you used most

#### Portfolio
- One worked near‑double with model and equation

#### Safety
- Mind marker caps and small counters
