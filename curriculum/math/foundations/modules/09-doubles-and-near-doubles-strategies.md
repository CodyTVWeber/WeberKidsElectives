### Doubles and near‑doubles strategies

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Recall doubles within 20 (e.g., 6 + 6)
- Use near‑doubles (e.g., 6 + 7 as 6 + 6 + 1)
- Explain why near‑doubles work using models
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, number line, whiteboard, dot cards
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Double, near‑double, adjust, strategy
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How can knowing 8 + 8 help solve 8 + 9 quickly?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach one near‑double with a visual model
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Review doubles with flash cards or dot cards
2) Model near‑doubles on number line and with counters
3) Practice mixed problems; explain adjustments aloud
4) Stop Here: star the strategy you used most
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- One worked near‑double with model and equation
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Mind marker caps and small counters
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
