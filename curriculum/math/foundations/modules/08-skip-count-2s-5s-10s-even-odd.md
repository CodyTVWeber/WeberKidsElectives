### Skip‑count by 2s/5s/10s; even/odd

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Skip‑count by 2s, 5s, and 10s starting from 0
- Identify even and odd numbers within 100
- Connect skip‑counting to groups and arrays
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Hundred chart, counters, base‑ten rods, dot stickers
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Skip‑count, even, odd, pattern, multiple
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How does coloring the hundred chart reveal patterns for 2s/5s/10s?
- What makes a number even or odd?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Demonstrate a skip‑count song or chant and explain the pattern
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Color 2s, 5s, 10s on a hundred chart; discuss patterns
2) Build groups: pairs for 2s, fives for 5s, rods for 10s
3) Even/odd test: pair up counters; leftovers mean odd
4) Stop Here: write one pattern you observed
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of chart section and a sentence about the pattern
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep stickers and small counters away from mouths
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
