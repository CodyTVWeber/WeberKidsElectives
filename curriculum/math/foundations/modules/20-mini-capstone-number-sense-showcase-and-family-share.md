### Mini‑capstone: number sense showcase and family share

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Synthesize number sense skills from modules 1–19
- Present one problem solved two ways with a clear explanation
- Share a short reflection and next step
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Choice of manipulatives, whiteboard, selected prior work
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Strategy, model, reflect
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Which two strategies feel most efficient for you and why?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Family showcase: one 2–3 minute presentation with Q&A
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Select a favorite problem type and models
2) Prepare two solution methods (e.g., make‑10 and number line)
3) Rehearse explanation; present to family
4) Stop Here: write a next step goal
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of presentation setup and a written next‑step goal
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep workspace organized; gentle with shared materials
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
