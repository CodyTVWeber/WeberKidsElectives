Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Place numbers on a 0–100 number line
- Compare two‑digit numbers using place value and symbols (<, >, =)
- Explain comparisons using tens and ones

#### Materials (prep)
- Blank number line, hundred chart, digit cards

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Greater than, less than, equal, number line

#### Logic prompts
- How do tens decide most comparisons before looking at ones?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain why 58 > 49 using a model and symbols

#### Procedure
1) Place target numbers on a number line; check with chart
2) Compare pairs; write with symbols and a sentence
3) Mixed practice with close numbers (e.g., 47 vs 45)
4) Stop Here: write one tricky comparison and explain

#### Portfolio
- One comparison with a supporting model and sentence

#### Safety
- Keep small cards organized; avoid paper cuts
