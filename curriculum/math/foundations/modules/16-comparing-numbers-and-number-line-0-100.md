### Comparing numbers and number line (0–100)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Place numbers on a 0–100 number line
- Compare two‑digit numbers using place value and symbols (<, >, =)
- Explain comparisons using tens and ones
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Blank number line, hundred chart, digit cards
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Greater than, less than, equal, number line
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How do tens decide most comparisons before looking at ones?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain why 58 > 49 using a model and symbols
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Place target numbers on a number line; check with chart
2) Compare pairs; write with symbols and a sentence
3) Mixed practice with close numbers (e.g., 47 vs 45)
4) Stop Here: write one tricky comparison and explain
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- One comparison with a supporting model and sentence
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep small cards organized; avoid paper cuts
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
