### Geometry: 2D shapes, attributes, composing shapes

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Name common shapes (triangle, square, rectangle, circle, hexagon)
- Describe attributes: sides, vertices; equal lengths
- Compose larger shapes using pattern blocks or cutouts

#### Materials (prep)
- Pattern blocks or paper cutouts; attribute cards

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Side, vertex, equal, compose

#### Logic prompts
- How can two triangles make a square? A rectangle? A larger triangle?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Build and explain a composed shape using correct vocabulary

#### Procedure
1) Sort shapes; name and describe attributes
2) Compose new shapes with blocks; trace and label
3) Matching game: attributes to shapes
4) Stop Here: glue one traced composition into journal

#### Portfolio
- Composition tracing labeled with shape names and attributes

#### Safety
- Mind small pieces; careful with glue or scissors if used
