### Geometry: 2D shapes, attributes, composing shapes

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Name common shapes (triangle, square, rectangle, circle, hexagon)
- Describe attributes: sides, vertices; equal lengths
- Compose larger shapes using pattern blocks or cutouts
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Pattern blocks or paper cutouts; attribute cards
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Side, vertex, equal, compose
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How can two triangles make a square? A rectangle? A larger triangle?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Build and explain a composed shape using correct vocabulary
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Sort shapes; name and describe attributes
2) Compose new shapes with blocks; trace and label
3) Matching game: attributes to shapes
4) Stop Here: glue one traced composition into journal
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Composition tracing labeled with shape names and attributes
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Mind small pieces; careful with glue or scissors if used
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
