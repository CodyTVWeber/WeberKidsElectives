### Money: identify coins and count like coins

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters by value and features
- Count like coins (all pennies, all nickels, etc.)
- Begin mixed coin counting using skip‑count patterns
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Coin set (real or plastic), coin value chart
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Penny, nickel, dime, quarter, value, cents
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How do skip‑count patterns help count nickels and dimes?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain a strategy to count 5 dimes and 3 pennies
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Identify coins by size, color, ridges; state values
2) Count sets of like coins using skip‑counting
3) Try simple mixed sets; check with another method
4) Stop Here: record one coin combination and total
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo or sketch of a coin set with labeled total
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Supervise small coins; keep out of mouths; wash hands after
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
