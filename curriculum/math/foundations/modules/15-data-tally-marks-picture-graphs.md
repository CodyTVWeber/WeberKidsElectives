### Data: tally marks and picture graphs

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Collect simple data and record with tally marks
- Create and read a picture graph
- Ask and answer questions about the data
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Stickers or small items to sort, tally chart, graph template
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Data, tally, total, most, least
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- What does the graph show quickly that the tally list does not?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present the graph and share one conclusion
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Sort items by category; tally as you count
2) Transfer tallies to a picture graph
3) Ask and answer three questions about the graph
4) Stop Here: write a one‑sentence conclusion
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Completed picture graph with a conclusion sentence
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep small items organized; tidy workspace
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
