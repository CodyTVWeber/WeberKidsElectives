### Ten‑frames and subitizing

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Recognize quantities 1–10 on ten‑frames without counting by ones
- Decompose 10 into 5 and 5; see 7 as 5 and 2, etc.

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, counters, dot cards, whiteboard

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Subitize, ten‑frame, decompose, compose, quantity

#### Logic prompts
- How do arrangements help you know the number quickly?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show a dot card for 3 seconds and explain how you knew the number

#### Procedure
1) Flash dot cards; say totals; discuss groups you saw
2) Build numbers 6–9 on ten‑frames; explain 5+? structure
3) Quick draw: sketch a ten‑frame for 8 and label parts
4) Stop Here: note one number that was hard/easy to see

#### Portfolio
- Photo of quick draw with labels; one sentence reflection

#### Safety
- Keep counters in trays; tidy workspace
