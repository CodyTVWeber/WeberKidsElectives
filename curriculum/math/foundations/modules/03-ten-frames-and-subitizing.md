### Ten‑frames and subitizing

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Recognize quantities 1–10 on ten‑frames without counting by ones
- Decompose 10 into 5 and 5; see 7 as 5 and 2, etc.
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, counters, dot cards, whiteboard
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Subitize, ten‑frame, decompose, compose, quantity
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How do arrangements help you know the number quickly?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show a dot card for 3 seconds and explain how you knew the number
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Flash dot cards; say totals; discuss groups you saw
2) Build numbers 6–9 on ten‑frames; explain 5+? structure
3) Quick draw: sketch a ten‑frame for 8 and label parts
4) Stop Here: note one number that was hard/easy to see
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of quick draw with labels; one sentence reflection
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep counters in trays; tidy workspace
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
