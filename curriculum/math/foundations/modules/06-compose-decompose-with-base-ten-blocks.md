### Compose/decompose with base‑ten blocks

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Trade 10 ones for 1 ten and 1 ten for 10 ones
- Build numbers 11–30 using rods (tens) and units (ones)
- Decompose a number into different combinations of tens and ones

#### Materials (prep)
- Base‑ten blocks: units and rods; place value mat

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Ones, tens, compose, decompose, bundle, trade

#### Logic prompts
- Why is 14 both “one ten and four ones” and “fourteen ones”?
- How does bundling make counting faster?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show two different ways to represent 23 with blocks and explain

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up: count 10 ones → trade for 1 ten; repeat
2) Build 11–30 on the mat; say “__ tens and __ ones”
3) Decompose: trade back and forth while keeping the same total
4) Stop Here: draw one example and label tens/ones

#### Portfolio
- Photo/drawing of a build with labeled tens and ones

#### Safety
- Keep blocks on table to avoid slips; clean up promptly
