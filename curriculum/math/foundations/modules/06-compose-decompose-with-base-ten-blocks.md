### Compose/decompose with base‑ten blocks

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Trade 10 ones for 1 ten and 1 ten for 10 ones
- Build numbers 11–30 using rods (tens) and units (ones)
- Decompose a number into different combinations of tens and ones
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Base‑ten blocks: units and rods; place value mat
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Ones, tens, compose, decompose, bundle, trade
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Why is 14 both “one ten and four ones” and “fourteen ones”?
- How does bundling make counting faster?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show two different ways to represent 23 with blocks and explain
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up: count 10 ones → trade for 1 ten; repeat
2) Build 11–30 on the mat; say “__ tens and __ ones”
3) Decompose: trade back and forth while keeping the same total
4) Stop Here: draw one example and label tens/ones
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo/drawing of a build with labeled tens and ones
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep blocks on table to avoid slips; clean up promptly
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
