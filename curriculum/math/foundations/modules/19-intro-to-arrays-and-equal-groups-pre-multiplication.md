### Intro to arrays and equal groups (pre‑multiplication)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Build equal groups and arrays; connect to repeated addition
- Describe arrays by rows and columns
- Write repeated addition equations from arrays
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner
- Apply learned concepts to real-world problem-solving scenarios
- Develop mathematical communication skills through peer discussions
- Build confidence in explaining mathematical reasoning
#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, grid paper, stickers
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes
- Timer for pacing activities; clipboard for recording work
- Manipulative storage containers with labels
- Assessment rubric and progress tracking sheet
#### Grammar (vocab)
- Array, row, column, equal groups, repeated addition
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient
- Strategy, method, approach, solution path
- Verify, prove, justify, explain
- Pattern, sequence, relationship
#### Logic prompts
- How do arrays help you count quickly without missing any?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?
- What patterns do you notice? How could you extend them?
- If you changed one part of the problem, how would the answer change?
- Can you create a similar problem for a partner to solve?
#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present an array and describe it using rows/columns and an equation
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

- Create a math tutorial video for the class library
- Design a poster explaining your favorite strategy
- Write a letter to next year's students with helpful tips
#### Procedure
1) Build equal groups; write repeated addition
2) Arrange as arrays on grid paper; label rows/columns
3) Translate arrays to equations and vice versa
4) Stop Here: star one array you made and label it
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)
8) Partner check: Exchange work and verify each other's solutions (5 min)
9) Extension activity for early finishers: Create your own problem (optional)
10) Gallery walk: Display work and observe different solution strategies (5 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Provide number lines, hundred charts, or concrete manipulatives
- Support: Reduce number range (work within 10 instead of 20)
- Support: Offer sentence starters for mathematical explanations
- Challenge: Add constraints (solve without manipulatives)
- Challenge: Create word problems for given equations
- Challenge: Find multiple solution strategies and compare efficiency
- English Learners: Use visual models and gesture alongside vocabulary
#### Portfolio
- Photo/sketch of an array with labels and equation
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used
- Video explanation of problem-solving process (1-2 minutes)
- Collection of different solution methods with annotations
- Self-assessment rubric completion with evidence

#### Assessment
- Pre-assessment: Quick verbal check of prerequisite skills (2-3 questions)
- Formative: Observe and note student strategies during independent work
- Peer assessment: Partner checking with provided answer key
- Self-assessment: Students rate their confidence level (1-5) on each skill
- Exit ticket: One problem demonstrating the main concept
- Success criteria: 80% accuracy on independent practice problems
- Documentation: Photo of best work sample for portfolio

#### Home Connection
- Family math night: Play counting games together (board games, card games)
- Real-world practice: Count items while cooking or shopping
- Share strategies: Ask family members how they solve similar problems
- Math journal: Keep a book of interesting math discoveries
- Celebrate growth: Display best work on refrigerator or bulletin board
#### Safety
- Keep small pieces contained; tidy stickers
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
