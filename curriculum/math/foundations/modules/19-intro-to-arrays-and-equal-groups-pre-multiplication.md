### Intro to arrays and equal groups (pre‑multiplication)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Build equal groups and arrays; connect to repeated addition
- Describe arrays by rows and columns
- Write repeated addition equations from arrays
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, grid paper, stickers
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Array, row, column, equal groups, repeated addition
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How do arrays help you count quickly without missing any?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present an array and describe it using rows/columns and an equation
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Build equal groups; write repeated addition
2) Arrange as arrays on grid paper; label rows/columns
3) Translate arrays to equations and vice versa
4) Stop Here: star one array you made and label it
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo/sketch of an array with labels and equation
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep small pieces contained; tidy stickers
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
