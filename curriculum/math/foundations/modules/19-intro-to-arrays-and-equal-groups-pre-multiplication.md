### Intro to arrays and equal groups (preâ€‘multiplication)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Build equal groups and arrays; connect to repeated addition
- Describe arrays by rows and columns
- Write repeated addition equations from arrays

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, grid paper, stickers

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Array, row, column, equal groups, repeated addition

#### Logic prompts
- How do arrays help you count quickly without missing any?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present an array and describe it using rows/columns and an equation

#### Procedure
1) Build equal groups; write repeated addition
2) Arrange as arrays on grid paper; label rows/columns
3) Translate arrays to equations and vice versa
4) Stop Here: star one array you made and label it

#### Portfolio
- Photo/sketch of an array with labels and equation

#### Safety
- Keep small pieces contained; tidy stickers
