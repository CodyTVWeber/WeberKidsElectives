### Subtract within 20 (think addition and bridge‑10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Fluently subtract within 20 by thinking addition and bridging 10
- Explain decomposing a ten when needed
- Choose efficient strategies for different problems
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, number line, counters, whiteboard
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Decompose a ten, bridge‑10, unknown addend
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How can you turn 14 − 6 into a jump from 6 up to 14?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show two strategies for 15 − 7 and explain why they work
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Review unknown addend thinking on small numbers
2) Bridge‑10 on a number line: jump to 10, then to 14/15
3) Mixed practice; circle efficient strategy
4) Stop Here: note one subtraction that felt easy today
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- One solved example with both models and a sentence
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Manage small parts; keep workspace clear
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
