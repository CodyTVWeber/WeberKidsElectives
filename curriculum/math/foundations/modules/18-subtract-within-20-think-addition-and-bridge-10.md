### Subtract within 20 (think addition and bridge‑10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Fluently subtract within 20 by thinking addition and bridging 10
- Explain decomposing a ten when needed
- Choose efficient strategies for different problems

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, number line, counters, whiteboard

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Decompose a ten, bridge‑10, unknown addend

#### Logic prompts
- How can you turn 14 − 6 into a jump from 6 up to 14?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show two strategies for 15 − 7 and explain why they work

#### Procedure
1) Review unknown addend thinking on small numbers
2) Bridge‑10 on a number line: jump to 10, then to 14/15
3) Mixed practice; circle efficient strategy
4) Stop Here: note one subtraction that felt easy today

#### Portfolio
- One solved example with both models and a sentence

#### Safety
- Manage small parts; keep workspace clear
