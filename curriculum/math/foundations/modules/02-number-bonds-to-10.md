### Number bonds to 10 (pairs that make 10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Build and name all pairs that make 10
- Use number bond diagrams to show parts and whole
- Say related addition facts quickly

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, two‑color counters, number bond templates, number cards 0–10

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Whole, part, number bond, make‑10, sum

#### Logic prompts
- If you see 7, what is missing to make 10? How do you know?
- How does a number bond show parts and whole?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach someone two different pairs that make 10 and show both

#### Procedure
1) Fill a ten‑frame with 10; split into two colors; read the pair
2) Record as a number bond and an equation
3) Shuffle number cards; build the complement to make 10
4) Stop Here: checklist for at least five make‑10 pairs

#### Portfolio
- Number bond page with three examples and equations

#### Safety
- Keep counters off the floor to avoid slipping
