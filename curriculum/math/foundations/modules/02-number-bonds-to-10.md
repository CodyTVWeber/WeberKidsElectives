### Number bonds to 10 (pairs that make 10)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Build and name all pairs that make 10
- Use number bond diagrams to show parts and whole
- Say related addition facts quickly
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, two‑color counters, number bond templates, number cards 0–10
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Whole, part, number bond, make‑10, sum
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- If you see 7, what is missing to make 10? How do you know?
- How does a number bond show parts and whole?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach someone two different pairs that make 10 and show both
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Fill a ten‑frame with 10; split into two colors; read the pair
2) Record as a number bond and an equation
3) Shuffle number cards; build the complement to make 10
4) Stop Here: checklist for at least five make‑10 pairs
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Number bond page with three examples and equations
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep counters off the floor to avoid slipping
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
