### Measurement: length comparison and nonstandard units

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Compare lengths using language: longer/shorter, same length
- Measure with nonstandard units (paperclips, blocks) end‑to‑end
- Record and compare measurements; discuss fairness of units
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Paperclips/blocks, string, objects to measure, chart paper
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Length, longer, shorter, unit, measure, end‑to‑end
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- Why must units be the same size when comparing measurements?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present two objects measured with nonstandard units; explain method
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Compare objects by sight; verify with aligning starts
2) Measure with paperclips end‑to‑end; count and record
3) Discuss why mixed‑size units give unfair results
4) Stop Here: draw and label one measurement
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Measurement record with drawing and unit count
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep small items away from mouths; put away string carefully
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
