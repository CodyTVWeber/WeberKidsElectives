### Measurement: length comparison and nonstandard units

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Compare lengths using language: longer/shorter, same length
- Measure with nonstandard units (paperclips, blocks) end‑to‑end
- Record and compare measurements; discuss fairness of units

#### Materials (prep)
- Paperclips/blocks, string, objects to measure, chart paper

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Length, longer, shorter, unit, measure, end‑to‑end

#### Logic prompts
- Why must units be the same size when comparing measurements?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present two objects measured with nonstandard units; explain method

#### Procedure
1) Compare objects by sight; verify with aligning starts
2) Measure with paperclips end‑to‑end; count and record
3) Discuss why mixed‑size units give unfair results
4) Stop Here: draw and label one measurement

#### Portfolio
- Measurement record with drawing and unit count

#### Safety
- Keep small items away from mouths; put away string carefully
