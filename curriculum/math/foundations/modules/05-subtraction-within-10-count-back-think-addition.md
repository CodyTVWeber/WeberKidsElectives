### Subtraction within 10 (count back, think addition)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Subtract within 10 by counting back and by thinking addition
- Represent subtraction with counters, ten‑frames, and number lines
- Check subtraction by an inverse addition fact
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, ten‑frames, small number line, whiteboard/markers
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Subtract, difference, count back, unknown addend, inverse
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How can 9 − 6 be solved by thinking “what plus 6 makes 9”?
- When does counting back feel easier than counting on?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain two ways to solve 10 − 4 and show your work
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Build 10 on a ten‑frame; remove counters to see differences
2) Show 9 − 6 on a number line by jumps back and by unknown addend
3) Practice sets: model, write, check with addition
4) Stop Here: reflect on which model helped most today
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- One problem modeled with a number line and checked with addition
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep small parts organized; cap markers after use
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
