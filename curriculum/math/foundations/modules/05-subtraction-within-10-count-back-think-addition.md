### Subtraction within 10 (count back, think addition)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Subtract within 10 by counting back and by thinking addition
- Represent subtraction with counters, ten‑frames, and number lines
- Check subtraction by an inverse addition fact

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, ten‑frames, small number line, whiteboard/markers

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Subtract, difference, count back, unknown addend, inverse

#### Logic prompts
- How can 9 − 6 be solved by thinking “what plus 6 makes 9”?
- When does counting back feel easier than counting on?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain two ways to solve 10 − 4 and show your work

#### Procedure
1) Build 10 on a ten‑frame; remove counters to see differences
2) Show 9 − 6 on a number line by jumps back and by unknown addend
3) Practice sets: model, write, check with addition
4) Stop Here: reflect on which model helped most today

#### Portfolio
- One problem modeled with a number line and checked with addition

#### Safety
- Keep small parts organized; cap markers after use
