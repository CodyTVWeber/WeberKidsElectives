### Place value: tens and ones; expanded form

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Identify the value of a digit in the tens and ones places
- Write numbers 10–99 in expanded form (e.g., 47 = 40 + 7)
- Compare models and symbols for the same number
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Base‑ten blocks, place value chart, digit cards, whiteboard
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Digit, place value, tens, ones, expanded form
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- How does the position of a digit change its value?
- Why does 70 + 2 equal 72 even if there are no ones shown first?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present an expanded form example with blocks and an equation
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Build 2–3 numbers with blocks; say and write expanded form
2) Match digit cards to build a target number on the chart
3) Quick compare: which is greater, 36 or 63? Explain using place value
4) Stop Here: write and box one expanded form you like
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- One expanded form example with a small drawing and equation
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep small pieces contained; hands clear while trading blocks
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
