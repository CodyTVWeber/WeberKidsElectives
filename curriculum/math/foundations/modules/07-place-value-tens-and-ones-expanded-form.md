#### Objectives
- Identify the value of a digit in the tens and ones places
- Write numbers 10–99 in expanded form (e.g., 47 = 40 + 7)
- Compare models and symbols for the same number

#### Materials (prep)
- Base‑ten blocks, place value chart, digit cards, whiteboard

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Digit, place value, tens, ones, expanded form

#### Logic prompts
- How does the position of a digit change its value?
- Why does 70 + 2 equal 72 even if there are no ones shown first?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present an expanded form example with blocks and an equation

#### Procedure
1) Build 2–3 numbers with blocks; say and write expanded form
2) Match digit cards to build a target number on the chart
3) Quick compare: which is greater, 36 or 63? Explain using place value
4) Stop Here: write and box one expanded form you like

#### Portfolio
- One expanded form example with a small drawing and equation

#### Safety
- Keep small pieces contained; hands clear while trading blocks
