### Story problems; bar models and number bonds

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Translate a short story problem into a bar model or number bond
- Decide whether to add or subtract and explain why
- Check results with a different method
- Use multiple representations (ten‑frames, number lines, equations) to model thinking
- Justify strategy choice and compare efficiency with a partner

#### Materials (prep)
- Story problem cards, bar model templates, counters, whiteboard
- Number line strips; dry‑erase markers; small sticky notes

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Bar model, number bond, unknown, equation
- Equation
- Representation
- Efficient

#### Logic prompts
- What words in a story hint at addition or subtraction?
- How does the model help you “see” the problem?
- When might a number line be clearer than a ten‑frame?
- How can you check if an answer is reasonable?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Present one story problem, model, and solution to the family
- Record a 20‑second explanation of one problem for your portfolio

#### Procedure
1) Read a simple story problem aloud together
2) Draw a bar model or number bond; label parts/whole
3) Write the equation; solve; check another way
4) Stop Here: add one new story to the card stack
5) Guided practice: 3 mixed problems with think‑aloud (8–10 min)
6) Independent practice: 4–6 problems with choice of model (10–12 min)
7) Reflection: choose one problem and explain your strategy (3–5 min)

#### Portfolio
- Photo of solved story card with model and equation
- Attach the reflection sentence and highlight the representation used

#### Safety
- Keep markers capped; tidy counters promptly
- Keep floors clear of small pieces; store manipulatives neatly
