### Music/Singing Curriculum (progression-based)

Mirrors the mechanics curriculum structure: foundations modules, syllabus, templates, resources, and a builder that composes one progression doc without time references. Suggested age ranges guide readiness.

Use these with `templates/` and `foundations/syllabus.md`. The `build_progression_music.py` script writes `build/music-progression.md`.
