Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Shift volume on cue between soft (p) and medium (mf)
- Keep pitch center while changing dynamics

#### Materials
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/Row_Row_Row_Your_Boat_C.ly`

#### Grammar
- Dynamics, soft (p), medium (mf)

#### Logic
- Why can singing softer be harder to keep on pitch?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing one phrase soft then medium for a listener

#### Procedure
1) Warmup at comfortable volume
2) Practice soft vs medium on single notes
3) Apply to one phrase; stay on pitch
4) Stop Here

#### Portfolio
- Note which volume felt easier to control

#### Safety
- Avoid pushing for loud; prioritize ease
