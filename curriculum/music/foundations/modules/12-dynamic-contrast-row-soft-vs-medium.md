### Dynamic Contrast (Row—soft vs medium)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Shift volume on cue between soft (p) and medium (mf)
- Keep pitch center while changing dynamics
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Row_Row_Row_Your_Boat_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Dynamics, soft (p), medium (mf)
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Why can singing softer be harder to keep on pitch?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing one phrase soft then medium for a listener
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Warmup at comfortable volume
2) Practice soft vs medium on single notes
3) Apply to one phrase; stay on pitch
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Note which volume felt easier to control
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Avoid pushing for loud; prioritize ease
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
