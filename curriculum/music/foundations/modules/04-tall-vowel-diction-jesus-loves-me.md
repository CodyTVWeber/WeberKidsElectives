### Tall Vowel Diction (Jesus Loves Me v1)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Shape tall vowels and relaxed jaw
- Sing one verse with gentle phrasing
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Jesus_Loves_Me_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Vowel, diction, phrase
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- What changes when your jaw relaxes for “loooove”?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Share what “love” means; sing the last line
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Vowel chain: ah‑eh‑ee‑oh‑oo on C
2) Speak text slowly; tall vowels
3) Sing v1; shape endings
4) Stop Here; water sip
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Circle one tall vowel in the score; write one word about the song
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- No jaw tension; rest if tired
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
