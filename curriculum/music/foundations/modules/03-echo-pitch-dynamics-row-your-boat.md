### Echo Pitch & Simple Dynamics (Row, Row, Row Your Boat)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Echo 3‑note patterns accurately
- Explore soft vs medium singing
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Row_Row_Row_Your_Boat_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Echo, dynamics, soft (p), medium (mf)
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- How do we show “merrily” with our sound and face?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing “merrily” line with a happy face for family
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Breath: balloon belly; hiss 6 counts
2) Warmup: do–mi–so
3) Echo patterns (3 notes)
4) Song: soft vs medium phrases
5) Stop Here; sticker
6) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
7) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
8) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Draw two faces: soft and medium; circle which felt better
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep volume comfortable; no forcing
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
