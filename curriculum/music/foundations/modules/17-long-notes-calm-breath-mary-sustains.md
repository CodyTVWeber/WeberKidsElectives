### Long Notes, Calm Breath (Mary sustains)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Sustain a comfortable note with steady tone
- Place breaths only at phrase ends
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Mary_Had_a_Little_Lamb_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Sustain, steady tone, breath placement
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- What changes if the breath is high in the chest vs lower?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Hold one comfortable note and show steady tone for family
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Breath low; hiss for 6–8 counts
2) Sustain “ah” for a comfortable count; smooth release
3) Apply to one phrase in Mary
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Record best comfortable sustain count
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- No straining; keep it easy
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
