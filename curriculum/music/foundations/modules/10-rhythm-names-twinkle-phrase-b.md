Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Speak and clap rhythm syllables (ta / ti‑ti)
- Keep steady beat while singing
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Twinkle_Twinkle_simple_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Beat, rhythm, ta, ti‑ti
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- What changes when two sounds fit into one beat?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Teach a family member how to clap ti‑ti
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Clap quarters vs two eighths
2) Speak phrase B rhythm; then sing it
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Circle one ti‑ti bar on the score
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Gentle hands and voice
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
