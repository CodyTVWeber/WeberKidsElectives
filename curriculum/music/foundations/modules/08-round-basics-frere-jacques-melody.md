### Round Basics (Frère Jacques melody)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Learn melody confidently before overlapping entries
- Count a one‑bar intro
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Frere_Jacques_round_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Round, entry, overlap
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Why does practicing melody alone help the round later?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Hum melody while parent sings; switch
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Sing melody straight; clap one‑bar intro
2) Parent sings melody; child hums
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Mark first note and entry bar number
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Gentle volume; listen first, then sing
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
