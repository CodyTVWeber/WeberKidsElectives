Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Learn melody confidently before overlapping entries
- Count a one‑bar intro
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time
- Develop active listening skills to identify pitch and rhythm patterns
- Build ensemble awareness through group singing activities
- Connect musical concepts to emotional expression
#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Frere_Jacques_round_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device
- Recording device for self-assessment; music stand
- Stickers or stamps for motivation; practice log
- Visual aids for pitch and rhythm concepts
#### Grammar
- Round, entry, overlap
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape
- Timbre, tone quality, resonance
- Articulation, phrasing, expression
- Ensemble, balance, blend
#### Logic
- Why does practicing melody alone help the round later?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?
- How does changing tempo affect the mood of the piece?
- What makes two voices blend well together?
- How do you know when you're singing in tune?
#### Rhetoric
- Hum melody while parent sings; switch
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

- Perform in a small recital for family and friends
- Create program notes explaining the piece's meaning
- Record a practice tips video for beginners
#### Procedure
1) Sing melody straight; clap one‑bar intro
2) Parent sings melody; child hums
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)
7) Partner feedback: Sing for a partner and receive constructive feedback (5 min)
8) Recording and self-assessment: Listen back and identify areas to improve (5 min)
9) Cool-down: Gentle humming and relaxation exercises (3 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Sing on a neutral syllable before adding words
- Support: Reduce range to comfortable notes only
- Support: Provide visual pitch ladder or hand signs
- Challenge: Add harmony line or descant
- Challenge: Incorporate dynamics and expression markings
- Challenge: Lead warm-ups or teach a phrase to others
- Sensory needs: Offer noise-reducing headphones during loud activities
#### Portfolio
- Mark first note and entry bar number
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal
- Before and after recordings showing improvement
- Annotated sheet music with performance notes
- Reflection journal entry on challenges and breakthroughs

#### Assessment
- Warm-up check: Listen for accurate pitch matching in opening exercises
- Technique observation: Note posture, breath support, and vowel formation
- Peer feedback: Partners provide one compliment and one suggestion
- Recording analysis: Students identify strengths and areas for improvement
- Performance rubric: Tone quality, accuracy, expression, and stage presence
- Progress tracking: Mark improvement areas on individual progress chart
- Celebration: Acknowledge specific improvements from previous session

#### Home Connection
- Family sing-along: Share learned songs at dinner or bedtime
- Practice buddy: Designate a family member as practice audience
- Music appreciation: Listen to professional recordings together
- Performance calendar: Mark upcoming sharing opportunities
- Progress celebration: Record monthly to hear improvement over time
#### Safety
- Gentle volume; listen first, then sing
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
