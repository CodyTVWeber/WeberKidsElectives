### Interval Sense (do–mi, do–so)—solfège drills

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Hear and sing 3rd and 5th above do
- Switch between step and skip patterns
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/solfege_patterns_C_major.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Interval, third, fifth, do, mi, so
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- How does a skip (third) feel compared to a step?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate do–mi–do and do–so–do for a listener
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Warmup: do–re–mi 3‑note steps
2) Drill do–mi and do–so patterns with piano app
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Draw do at bottom; mi higher; so highest; label
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Gentle voice; hydrate
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
