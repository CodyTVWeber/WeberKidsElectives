### Breath Timing (Amazing Grace v1)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Place breaths at phrase ends
- Sustain a calm tone
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Amazing_Grace_simple_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Breath mark, sustain, phrase end
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Why is a quick, quiet breath better than a loud one?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing one line and show where to breathe on the page
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Breath: in through nose, out on "sss"
2) Mark breaths with pencil at phrase ends
3) Sing line by line; no gasp between words
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Add breath marks to the score; note longest sustain
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Rest voice if tired; sip water
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
