#### Grammar
- Breath mark, sustain, phrase end
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape
- Timbre, tone quality, resonance
- Articulation, phrasing, expression
- Ensemble, balance, blend
#### Logic
- Why is a quick, quiet breath better than a loud one?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?
- How does changing tempo affect the mood of the piece?
- What makes two voices blend well together?
- How do you know when you're singing in tune?
#### Rhetoric
- Sing one line and show where to breathe on the page
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

- Perform in a small recital for family and friends
- Create program notes explaining the piece's meaning
- Record a practice tips video for beginners
#### Procedure
1) Breath: in through nose, out on "sss"
2) Mark breaths with pencil at phrase ends
3) Sing line by line; no gasp between words
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)
8) Partner feedback: Sing for a partner and receive constructive feedback (5 min)
9) Recording and self-assessment: Listen back and identify areas to improve (5 min)
10) Cool-down: Gentle humming and relaxation exercises (3 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Sing on a neutral syllable before adding words
- Support: Reduce range to comfortable notes only
- Support: Provide visual pitch ladder or hand signs
- Challenge: Add harmony line or descant
- Challenge: Incorporate dynamics and expression markings
- Challenge: Lead warm-ups or teach a phrase to others
- Sensory needs: Offer noise-reducing headphones during loud activities
#### Portfolio
- Add breath marks to the score; note longest sustain
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal
- Before and after recordings showing improvement
- Annotated sheet music with performance notes
- Reflection journal entry on challenges and breakthroughs

#### Assessment
- Warm-up check: Listen for accurate pitch matching in opening exercises
- Technique observation: Note posture, breath support, and vowel formation
- Peer feedback: Partners provide one compliment and one suggestion
