### Hymn Verse Memory (Jesus Loves Me—no sheet)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Sing one hymn verse from memory
- Keep gentle phrasing and tall vowels
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Jesus_Loves_Me_C.ly` (for reference only)
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Memory, verse, phrasing
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- What helps you remember the order of lines?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing the verse for family without looking
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Speak lines in order; clap beat
2) Close score; sing the verse
3) Stop Here; smile finish
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Write first words of each line as a cue list
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep volume comfortable
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
