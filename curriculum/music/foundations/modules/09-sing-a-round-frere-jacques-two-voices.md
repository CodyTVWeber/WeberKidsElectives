### Sing a Round (Frère Jacques 2 voices)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Enter one bar after the leader
- Hold your line while hearing the other part
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Frere_Jacques_round_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Entry, part, blend
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- How do you keep your part steady when the other voice is different?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Perform a 2‑voice round for a family member
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Clap 1‑bar intro; parent starts; child enters on bar 2
2) Sing full round; switch roles
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Check box: “Held my line without rushing”
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep it light; avoid shouting
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
