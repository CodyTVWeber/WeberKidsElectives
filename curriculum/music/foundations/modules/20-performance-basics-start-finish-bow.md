### Performance Basics (start note, finish, bow)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Find and sing the start note confidently
- Begin together; finish still; friendly bow
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- Tuning bell/piano app for C
- Any prior learned song score
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Start note, cadence, bow
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Why is stillness at the end powerful for the audience?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Present one short song for family with start and finish cues
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Hear and sing start note (C)
2) Count‑in; begin together
3) Finish with stillness; smile; bow
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Note which song was performed; circle the start note on the score
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep posture comfortable; no strain
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
