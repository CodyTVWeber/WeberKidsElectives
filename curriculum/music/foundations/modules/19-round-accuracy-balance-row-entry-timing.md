### Round Accuracy & Balance (Row entry timing)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Start on correct bar; hold pitch center while overlapping
- Balance volume to hear both parts
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Row_Row_Row_Your_Boat_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Balance, entry timing, overlap
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- What helps you hear your part and the other at the same time?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Perform the round with a controlled start and finish
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Count 1‑bar intro; enter correctly
2) Sing full round; adjust volume for blend
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Check box: “Started on time” and “Kept pitch center”
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Avoid shouting; listen actively
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
