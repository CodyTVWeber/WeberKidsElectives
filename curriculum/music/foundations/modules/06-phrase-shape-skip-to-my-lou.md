### Phrase Shape (Skip to My Lou)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Feel phrase arc (grow then relax)
- Track the highest note in a phrase
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Skip_To_My_Lou_C.ly`
- Scarf/ribbon
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Phrase, arc, cadence
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Why do we avoid a hard stop in the middle of a phrase?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing first phrase while moving scarf in an arc
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Warmup: gentle siren; do–so
2) Trace phrase arc with scarf as you sing
3) Circle highest note on printout
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Sketch a rainbow line over the phrase; mark cadence
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Relaxed breath; no forcing
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
