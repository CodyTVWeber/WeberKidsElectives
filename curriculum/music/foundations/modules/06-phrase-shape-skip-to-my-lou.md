#### Grammar
- Phrase, arc, cadence
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape
- Timbre, tone quality, resonance
- Articulation, phrasing, expression
- Ensemble, balance, blend
#### Logic
- Why do we avoid a hard stop in the middle of a phrase?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?
- How does changing tempo affect the mood of the piece?
- What makes two voices blend well together?
- How do you know when you're singing in tune?
#### Rhetoric
- Sing first phrase while moving scarf in an arc
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

- Perform in a small recital for family and friends
- Create program notes explaining the piece's meaning
- Record a practice tips video for beginners
#### Procedure
1) Warmup: gentle siren; do–so
2) Trace phrase arc with scarf as you sing
3) Circle highest note on printout
4) Stop Here
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)
8) Partner feedback: Sing for a partner and receive constructive feedback (5 min)
9) Recording and self-assessment: Listen back and identify areas to improve (5 min)
10) Cool-down: Gentle humming and relaxation exercises (3 min)

#### Differentiation
- Support: Sing on a neutral syllable before adding words
- Support: Reduce range to comfortable notes only
- Support: Provide visual pitch ladder or hand signs
- Challenge: Add harmony line or descant
- Challenge: Incorporate dynamics and expression markings
- Challenge: Lead warm-ups or teach a phrase to others
- Sensory needs: Offer noise-reducing headphones during loud activities
#### Portfolio
- Sketch a rainbow line over the phrase; mark cadence
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal
- Before and after recordings showing improvement
- Annotated sheet music with performance notes
- Reflection journal entry on challenges and breakthroughs

#### Assessment
- Warm-up check: Listen for accurate pitch matching in opening exercises
- Technique observation: Note posture, breath support, and vowel formation
- Peer feedback: Partners provide one compliment and one suggestion
- Recording analysis: Students identify strengths and areas for improvement
- Performance rubric: Tone quality, accuracy, expression, and stage presence
- Progress tracking: Mark improvement areas on individual progress chart
- Celebration: Acknowledge specific improvements from previous session
