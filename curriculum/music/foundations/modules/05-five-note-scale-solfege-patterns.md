### Five-Note Scale (do–so) and Solfège patterns

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Sing C–G five‑note scale up/down on solfège
- Identify steps vs skips
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/solfege_patterns_C_major.ly`
- `sheet_music/warmups_five_note_scale_C_major.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Solfège, step, skip, scale
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- How does a skip sound different from a step?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate one step and one skip for a listener
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Breath: in 4, hiss 8
2) Scale up/down: do‑re‑mi‑fa‑so‑fa‑mi‑re‑do
3) Steps vs skips hands; point to notes
4) Stop Here; sticker
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Draw a staircase for the scale; label do at the bottom
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep volume gentle; hydrate
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
