### Read Steps C–G (Mary full)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Track stepwise motion on the staff from C to G
- Match note heads to solfège or letter names
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Mary_Had_a_Little_Lamb_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Step, staff, note head, line, space
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- How do you know the note went up or down on the staff?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Point‑and‑sing one line while naming the steps
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Identify C on staff; trace to G
2) Point to each step as you sing Mary
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Draw 5 lines; place a note on a line and a space
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Stay relaxed; small voice
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
