### Beat vs. Words (Mary Had a Little Lamb)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Separate steady beat from words
- Clap while speaking lyrics; then sing on beat
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Mary_Had_a_Little_Lamb_C.ly` (print)
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Beat, rhythm, lyric, steady
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- What happens if the words rush but the beat is steady?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Clap 8 beats while parent sings; switch roles
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Clap beat while speaking lyrics
2) Speak rhythm (ta / ti‑ti); then sing
3) Two lines with clear consonants; smile finish
4) Stop Here; note next step
5) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
6) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
7) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Circle one bar with ti‑ti; write “steady beat felt?”
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Gentle clapping; keep voice easy
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
