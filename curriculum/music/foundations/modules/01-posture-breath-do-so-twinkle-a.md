#### Procedure
1) Posture check; quiet ready; soft knees
2) Breath game: “smell the flower, blow the candle” with scarf
3) Warmups: hum C; lip trills; siren C–G
4) Do–so echo; parent → child
5) Songwork: Twinkle phrase A; soft vs medium
6) Stop Here: sticker; note next step
7) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
8) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
9) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Short note on breath cue felt; draw start note “C” and “G”
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- No shouting; sip water; rest if voice feels tired
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
