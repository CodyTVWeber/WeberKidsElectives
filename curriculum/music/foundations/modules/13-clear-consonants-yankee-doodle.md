### Clear Consonants (Yankee Doodle)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Exaggerate consonants for clarity
- Keep rhythm steady while articulating
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Yankee_Doodle_C.ly`
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Consonant, articulation, diction
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Which words are hard to understand if consonants are soft?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Speak a line like a tongue‑twister; then sing it clearly
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Speak lyric slowly; over‑articulate consonants
2) Clap beat; sing the line with clarity
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Write one tricky word and circle its consonants
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep jaw relaxed; no tension
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
