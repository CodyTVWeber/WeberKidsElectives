### Pitch Center & Tempo (Amazing Grace steady)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Maintain pitch center at a slow tempo
- Avoid dragging or rushing
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Amazing_Grace_simple_C.ly`
- Metronome (slow, e.g., 60–66 BPM)
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Pitch center, tempo, steady
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- Why does slow singing test breath and pitch more?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing one line with metronome clicks, then without
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Set metronome; clap steady
2) Sing line with clicks; then remove clicks
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Note a comfy tempo; write “felt steady?” yes/no
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Rest between attempts; no pushing
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
