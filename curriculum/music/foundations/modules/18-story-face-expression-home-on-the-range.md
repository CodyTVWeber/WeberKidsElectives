### Story/Face Expression (Home on the Range)

Use: `../../templates/weekly-session-template.md`, `../../templates/stop-here-checklist.md`

#### Objectives
- Match face and tone to song meaning
- Shape a phrase with a gentle swell
- Maintain posture and tall vowels throughout phrases
- Self‑monitor breath marks and dynamics; adjust in real time

#### Materials
- `sheet_music/Home_On_The_Range_C.ly`
- Scarf for phrase arc
- Pencil for score marks; metronome app or device

#### Grammar
- Expression, phrase swell, storytelling
- Posture
- Dynamics
- Phrase shape

#### Logic
- How does your face change the listener’s feeling?
- How does lighter volume help tuning when singing a round?
- Where is the best place to breathe in this phrase and why?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing one phrase and explain the story in one sentence
- Perform for a peer/family member and describe one improvement

#### Procedure
1) Talk about the song’s picture/feeling
2) Sing phrase while tracing arc with scarf
3) Stop Here
4) Solfege or tone warm‑up aligned to the piece (3–5 min)
5) Targeted drill: 2 tricky measures on a neutral syllable (5–7 min)
6) Run‑through with dynamic plan, then debrief (5–8 min)

#### Portfolio
- Draw one face that matches the song
- Circle the most in‑tune measure; write one breath or vowel goal

#### Safety
- Keep volume moderate; relaxed jaw
- Use moderate volume; rest voice between repetitions
