Suggested ages: 3–7


#### Objectives
- Establish tall posture and quiet ready
- Breath cue and gentle warmups (hum, lip trills)
- Match do–so patterns and sing Twinkle phrase A

#### Materials (prep)
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/Twinkle_Twinkle_simple_C.ly` (print)
- Scarf/ribbon; metronome ~72 BPM

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Posture, breath, do, so, melody, beat

#### Logic prompts
- How does standing tall change your sound?
- Why is a gentle breath helpful before singing?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Sing phrase A for a family member with a smile at the end

#### Procedure
1) Posture check; quiet ready; soft knees
2) Breath game: “smell the flower, blow the candle” with scarf
3) Warmups: hum C; lip trills; siren C–G
4) Do–so echo; parent → child
5) Songwork: Twinkle phrase A; soft vs medium
6) Stop Here: sticker; note next step

#### Portfolio
- Short note on breath cue felt; draw start note “C” and “G”

#### Safety
- No shouting; sip water; rest if voice feels tired


### Beat vs. Words (Mary Had a Little Lamb)
Suggested ages: 3–7


#### Objectives
- Separate steady beat from words
- Clap while speaking lyrics; then sing on beat

#### Materials
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/Mary_Had_a_Little_Lamb_C.ly` (print)

#### Grammar
- Beat, rhythm, lyric, steady

#### Logic
- What happens if the words rush but the beat is steady?

#### Rhetoric
- Clap 8 beats while parent sings; switch roles

#### Procedure
1) Clap beat while speaking lyrics
2) Speak rhythm (ta / ti‑ti); then sing
3) Two lines with clear consonants; smile finish
4) Stop Here; note next step

#### Portfolio
- Circle one bar with ti‑ti; write “steady beat felt?”

#### Safety
- Gentle clapping; keep voice easy


### Echo Pitch & Simple Dynamics (Row, Row, Row Your Boat)
Suggested ages: 3–7


#### Objectives
- Echo 3‑note patterns accurately
- Explore soft vs medium singing

#### Materials
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/Row_Row_Row_Your_Boat_C.ly`

#### Grammar
- Echo, dynamics, soft (p), medium (mf)

#### Logic
- How do we show “merrily” with our sound and face?

#### Rhetoric
- Sing “merrily” line with a happy face for family

#### Procedure
1) Breath: balloon belly; hiss 6 counts
2) Warmup: do–mi–so
3) Echo patterns (3 notes)
4) Song: soft vs medium phrases
5) Stop Here; sticker

#### Portfolio
- Draw two faces: soft and medium; circle which felt better

#### Safety
- Keep volume comfortable; no forcing


### Tall Vowel Diction (Jesus Loves Me v1)
Suggested ages: 3–7


#### Objectives
- Shape tall vowels and relaxed jaw
- Sing one verse with gentle phrasing

#### Materials
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/Jesus_Loves_Me_C.ly`

#### Grammar
- Vowel, diction, phrase

#### Logic
- What changes when your jaw relaxes for “loooove”?

#### Rhetoric
- Share what “love” means; sing the last line

#### Procedure
1) Vowel chain: ah‑eh‑ee‑oh‑oo on C
2) Speak text slowly; tall vowels
3) Sing v1; shape endings
4) Stop Here; water sip

#### Portfolio
- Circle one tall vowel in the score; write one word about the song

#### Safety
- No jaw tension; rest if tired


### Five-Note Scale (do–so) and Solfège patterns
Suggested ages: 3–7


#### Objectives
- Sing C–G five‑note scale up/down on solfège
- Identify steps vs skips

#### Materials
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/solfege_patterns_C_major.ly`
- `BellaAndPiper/sheet_music/warmups_five_note_scale_C_major.ly`

#### Grammar
- Solfège, step, skip, scale

#### Logic
- How does a skip sound different from a step?

#### Rhetoric
- Demonstrate one step and one skip for a listener

#### Procedure
1) Breath: in 4, hiss 8
2) Scale up/down: do‑re‑mi‑fa‑so‑fa‑mi‑re‑do
3) Steps vs skips hands; point to notes
4) Stop Here; sticker

#### Portfolio
