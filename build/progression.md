## Safety guide

### Safety guide (spiraled by age)

Always supervise. Use eye protection, closed-toe shoes, and gloves as appropriate. Keep blades, heat, AC mains, and fuel strictly under adult control.

#### Workshop rules
- Wear PPE; tie back hair; no loose clothing.
- Clear workspace; good lighting and ventilation.
- Tools back to home after use; wipe down and inspect.
- Parts control: trays, labeled bags, no loose fasteners on the floor.
- Only one power/edge/chemical hazard in play at a time.

#### Safety progression
- Suggested ages 6–7: hand tools, pinch points, parts management, magnet tray etiquette.
- Suggested ages 7–9: bike stands, cable tension, soldering safety (low-voltage DC only).
- Suggested ages 9–14: fuel handling outdoors, fumes, fire safety, hot surfaces, rotating parts, torque respect, jacking and stands (demo only at first).
- Suggested ages 14+: service manuals, lockout/tagout habits, battery disconnect, proper lifting, OBD2 scanner basics.

#### Fuel and chemicals
- Store in approved containers; work outdoors or in ventilated area.
- No ignition sources nearby. Keep a class B/C extinguisher accessible.
- Skin contact: wash immediately; dispose of rags safely.

#### First aid and emergencies
- Stock a basic kit (bandages, saline, tweezers). Know emergency contacts.
- Stop work on any cut, spark, smoke, smell of fuel, or tool malfunction.
