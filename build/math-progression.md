# Math curriculum: progression (ages 4–12)

This document is composed from the nested math curriculum. Time references are removed.
Use suggested ages as guidance and move at your pace.

## Resources and manipulatives

### Resources and manipulatives (Math)

- Base-ten blocks (units, rods, flats)
- Ten-frames and counters
- Number cards and dice
- Rulers, balance scale, measuring cups
- Clock with movable hands; coin set
- Pattern blocks; geoboard and rubber bands
- Whiteboard/markers; math journal
- Recommended references: `Beast Academy 1–3`, `Singapore Math 1–3`, `Kitchen Table Math`


## Foundations (suggested ages 4–8)


### Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence
Suggested ages: 4–8


#### Objectives
- Count objects up to 20 with one touch per item
- Say the last number as the total (cardinality)
- Arrange objects into lines or ten‑frames

#### Materials (prep)
- Counters, small toys, or blocks; ten‑frames; number cards 0–20

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Count, one‑to‑one, total, more, fewer, equal

#### Logic prompts
- How do you know you didn’t skip or double‑count?
- Why does the last number you say tell the total?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Explain to a family member how lining up objects helps counting

#### Procedure
1) Warm‑up count 1–20; place one counter per ten‑frame box
2) Match number cards to sets; check by touching each object once
3) Mixed practice: scramble, line up, recount; discuss total
4) Stop Here: circle a number that felt “just right” to count

#### Portfolio
- Photo of ten‑frame with labeled number; short reflection sentence

#### Safety
- Small parts caution; keep away from mouths and younger siblings


### Number bonds to 10 (pairs that make 10)
Suggested ages: 4–8


#### Objectives
- Build and name all pairs that make 10
- Use number bond diagrams to show parts and whole
- Say related addition facts quickly

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, two‑color counters, number bond templates, number cards 0–10

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Whole, part, number bond, make‑10, sum

#### Logic prompts
- If you see 7, what is missing to make 10? How do you know?
- How does a number bond show parts and whole?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Teach someone two different pairs that make 10 and show both

#### Procedure
1) Fill a ten‑frame with 10; split into two colors; read the pair
2) Record as a number bond and an equation
3) Shuffle number cards; build the complement to make 10
4) Stop Here: checklist for at least five make‑10 pairs

#### Portfolio
- Number bond page with three examples and equations

#### Safety
- Keep counters off the floor to avoid slipping


### Ten‑frames and subitizing
Suggested ages: 4–8


#### Objectives
- Recognize quantities 1–10 on ten‑frames without counting by ones
- Decompose 10 into 5 and 5; see 7 as 5 and 2, etc.

#### Materials (prep)
- Ten‑frames, counters, dot cards, whiteboard

#### Grammar (vocab)
- Subitize, ten‑frame, decompose, compose, quantity

#### Logic prompts
- How do arrangements help you know the number quickly?

#### Rhetoric (share)
- Show a dot card for 3 seconds and explain how you knew the number

#### Procedure
1) Flash dot cards; say totals; discuss groups you saw
2) Build numbers 6–9 on ten‑frames; explain 5+? structure
3) Quick draw: sketch a ten‑frame for 8 and label parts
4) Stop Here: note one number that was hard/easy to see

#### Portfolio
- Photo of quick draw with labels; one sentence reflection

#### Safety
- Keep counters in trays; tidy workspace


## Outline

### Foundations syllabus (suggested ages ~4–8)

Progression modules move concrete → pictorial → abstract, with manipulatives first. Use the math session template and end with the Stop Here checklist.

#### Theme 1: Number sense to ten
1. Counting and one‑to‑one correspondence
2. Number bonds to 10 (pairs that make 10)
3. Ten‑frames and subitizing (see quantities at a glance)
4. Addition within 10 (count on, make‑10)
5. Subtraction within 10 (count back, think addition)

#### Theme 2: Place value and beyond ten
6. Compose/decompose numbers with base‑ten blocks
7. Place value: tens and ones; expanded form
8. Skip‑count by 2s/5s/10s; even/odd

#### Theme 3: Operations and models
9. Doubles and near‑doubles strategies
10. Story problems; bar models and number bonds
